<h1>BRED OF THE DESERT</h1>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_1'></a>1</span><a id='link_1'></a>CHAPTER I<br /><span class='h2fs'>A COLT IS BORN</span></h2>

<p>It was high noon in the desert, but there was no dazzling sunlight. Over the
earth hung a twilight, a yellow-pink softness that flushed across the sky like
the approach of a shadow, covering everything yet concealing nothing, creeping
steadily onward, yet seemingly still, until, pressing low over the earth, it
took on changing color, from pink to gray, from gray to black&#8211;gloom that
precedes tropical showers. Then the wind came&#8211;a breeze rising as it were
from the hot earth&#8211;forcing the Spanish dagger to dipping acknowledgment,
sending dust-devils swirling across the slow curves of the desert&#8211;and then
the storm burst in all its might. For this was a storm&#8211;a sand-storm of the
Southwest.</p>

<p>Down the slopes to the west billowed giant clouds of sand. At the bottom
these clouds tumbled and surged and mounted, and then, resuming <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span> their headlong course, swept
across the flat land bordering the river, hurtled across the swollen Rio Grande
itself, and so on up the gentle rise of ground to the town, where they swung
through the streets in ruthless strides&#8211;banging signs, ripping up
roofings, snapping off branches&#8211;and then lurched out over the mesa to the
east. Here, as if in glee over their escape from city confines, they redoubled
in fury and tore down to earth&#8211;and enveloped Felipe Montoya, a young and
good-looking Mexican, and his team of scrawny horses plodding in a lumber
rigging, all in a stinging swirl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haya!&#8221; cried Felipe, as the first of the sand-laden winds struck
him, &#8220;Chivos&#8211;chivos!&#8221; And he shot out his whip, gave the lash
a twist over the off mare, and brought it down with a resounding thwack.
&#8220;R-run!&#8221; he snarled, and again brought the whip down upon the
emaciated mare. &#8220;You joost natural lazy! Thees storm&#8211;we&#8211;we
get-tin&#8217;&#8211;&#8221; His voice was carried away on the swirling
winds.</p>

<p>But the horses seemed not to hear the man; nor, in the case of the off mare,
to feel the bite of his lash. They continued to plod along the beaten trail,
heads drooping, ears flopping, hoofs scuffling disconsolately. Felipe,
accompanying each outburst with a mighty swing of his whip, swore and pleaded
and objurgated and threatened in turn. But all to no avail. The horses held
stolidly to their gait, plodding&#8211;even, after a time, dropping into slower
movement. Whereat Felipe, abandoning <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_3'></a>3</span> all hope, flung down reins and whip, and leaped off the
reach of the rigging. Prompt with the loosened lines the team came to a full
stop; and Felipe, snatching up a blanket, covered his head and shoulders with it
and squatted in the scant protection of a forward wheel.</p>

<p>The storm whipped and howled past. Felipe listened, noting each change in its
velocity as told by the sound of raging gusts outside, himself raging. Once he
lifted a corner of the blanket and peered out&#8211;only to suffer the sting of
a thousand needles. Again, he hunched his shoulders guardedly and endeavored to
roll a cigarette; but the tempestuous blasts discouraged this also, and with a
curse he dashed the tobacco from him. After that he remained still, listening,
until he heard an agreeable change outside. The screeching sank to a crooning;
the crooning dropped to a low, musical sigh. Flinging off the blanket, he rose
and swept the desert with eyes sand-filled and blinking.</p>

<p>The last of the yellow winds was eddying slowly past. All about him the air,
thinning rapidly, pulsated in the sun&#8217;s rays, which, beaming mildly down
upon the desert, were spreading everywhere in glorious sheen. To the east, the
mountains, stepping forth in the clearing atmosphere, lay revealed in a warmth
of soft purple; while the slopes to the west, over which the storm had broken,
shone in a wealth of dazzling yellow-white light&#8211;sunbeams scintillating
off myriads of tiny sand-cubes. The desert was itself again&#8211;bright,
resplendent-gripped in the clutch of solitude.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>Felipe tossed his
blanket back upon the reach of the rigging. Then he caught up reins and whip,
ready to go on. As he did so he paused in dismay.</p>

<p>For one of the mares was down! It was the off mare, the slower and the older
mare of the two. She was lying prone and she was breathing heavily. Covered as
she was with a thin layer of fine sand, and tightly girdled with chaotic harness
straps, she was a spectacle of abject misery.</p>

<p>But Felipe did not see this. All he saw, in the blinding rage which suddenly
possessed him, was a horse down, unready for duty, and beside her a horse
standing, ready for duty, but restrained by the other. Stringing out a volley of
oaths, he stepped to the side of the mare and jerked at her head, but she
refused stubbornly to get up on her feet.</p>

<p>Gripped in dismay deeper than at first, Felipe fell back in mechanical
resignation.</p>

<p>Was the mare dying? he asked himself. He could ill afford to lose a mare.
Horses cost seven and eight dollars, and he did not possess so much money.
Indeed, all the money he had in the world was three dollars, received for this
last load of wood in town. So, what to do! Cursing the mare had not helped
matters; nor could he accuse the storm, for there had been other storms, many of
them, and each had she successfully weathered&#8211;been ready, with its
passing, to go on! But not so this one! She&#8211;Huh? Could it be possible?
Ah!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>He looked at the
mare with new interest. And the longer he gazed the more his anger subsided,
became finally downright compassion. For he was reviewing a something he had
contemplated at odd times for weeks with many misgivings and tenacious
unbeliefs. Never had he understood it! Never would he understand that thing! So
why lose time in an effort to understand it now?</p>

<p>Dropping to his knees, he fell to work with feverish haste unbuckling straps
and bands. With the harness loose, he dragged it off and tossed it to one side.
Then, still moving feverishly, he led the mate to the mare off the trail, turned
to the wagon with bracing shoulder, backed it clear of the prostrate animal, and
swung it out of the way of future passing vehicles. It was sweltering work. When
it was done, with the sun, risen to its fierce zenith, beating down upon him
mercilessly, he strode off the trail, blowing and perspiring, and flung himself
down in the baking sand, where, though irritated by particles of sand which had
sifted down close inside his shirt, he nevertheless gave himself over to sober
reflections.</p>

<p>He was stalled till the next morning&#8211;he knew that. And he was without
food-supplies to carry him over. And he was ten miles on the one hand, and five
up-canyon miles on the other, from all source of supplies. But against these
unpleasant facts there stood many pleasant facts&#8211;he was on the return leg
of his journey, his wagon was empty, and he had in his possession three dollars.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span> Then, too, there was
another pleasant fact. The trip as a trip had been unusual; never before had he,
or any one else, made it under two days&#8211;one for loading and driving into
town, and a second for getting rid of the wood and making the return. Yet he
himself had been out now only the one day, and he was on his way home. He had
whipped and crowded his horses since midnight to just this end. Yet was he not
stalled now till morning? And would not this delay set him back the one day he
had gained over his fellow-townsmen? And would not these same fellow-townsmen
rejoice in this opportunity to overtake him&#8211;worse, to leave him behind?
They would!</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; he concluded, philosophically, stretching out upon
his back and drawing his worn and ragged sombrero over his eyes, &#8220;soon is
comin&#8217; a <i>potrillo</i>.&#8221; With this he deliberately courted
slumber.</p>

<p>Out of the stillness rattled a wagon. Like Felipe&#8217;s, it was a lumber
rigging, and the driver, a fat Mexican with beady eyes, pulled up his horses and
gazed at the disorder. It was but a perfunctory gaze, however, and revealed to
him nothing of the true situation. All he saw was that Felipe was drunk and
asleep, and that before dropping beside the trail he had had time, and perhaps
just enough wit, to unhitch one horse. The other, true to instinct and the law
of her underfed and overworked kind, had lain down. With this conclusion, and
out of sheer exuberance of alcoholic <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_7'></a>7</span> spirits, he decided to awaken Felipe. And this he
did&#8211;in true Mexican fashion. With a curse of but five words&#8211;words of
great scope and finest selection, however&#8211;he mercilessly raked
Felipe&#8217;s ancestors for five generations back; he objurgated Felipe&#8217;s
holdings&#8211;chickens, adobe house, money, burro, horses, pigs. He closed,
snarling not obscurely at Felipe the man and at any progeny of his which might
appear in the future. Then he dropped his reins and sprang off the reach of his
rigging.</p>

<p>Felipe was duly awakened. He gained his feet slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know me, eh?&#8221; he retorted, advancing toward the other.
&#8220;All right&#8211;<i>gracios</i>!&#8221; And by way of coals of fire he
proffered the fellow-townsman papers and tobacco.</p>

<p>The new-comer revealed surprise, not alone at Felipe&#8217;s sobriety, though
this was startling in view of the disorder in the trail, but also at the proffer
of cigarette material. And he was about to speak when Felipe interrupted
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You haf t&#8217;ink I&#8217;m drunk, eh, Franke?&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Sure! Why not?&#8221; And he waved his hand in the direction of the
trail. Then, after the other had rolled a cigarette and returned the sack and
papers, he laid a firm hand upon the man&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;You coom
look,&#8221; he invited. &#8220;You tell me what you t&#8217;ink thees!&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked to the mare, and Franke gazed a long moment in silence. Felipe
stood beside him, eying him sharply, hoping for an expression of <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span> approval&#8211;even of
congratulation. In this he was doomed to disappointment, for the other continued
silent, and in silence finally turned back, his whole attitude that of one who
saw nothing in the spectacle worthy of comment. Felipe followed him, nettled,
and sat down and himself rolled a cigarette. As he sat smoking it the other
seated himself beside him, and presently touched him on the arm and began to
speak. Felipe listened, with now and again a nod of approval, and, when the
<i>compadre</i> was finished, accepted the brilliant proposition.</p>

<p>&#8220;A bet, eh?&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;All right!&#8221; And he
produced his sheepskin pouch and dumped out his three dollars. &#8220;All right!
I bet you feety cents, Franke, thot eet don&#8217; be!&#8221;</p>

<p>Frank looked his disdain at the amount offered. Also, his eyes blazed and his
round face reddened. He shoved his hand into his overalls, brought forth a
silver dollar, and tossed it down in the sand.</p>

<p>&#8220;A bet!&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;Mek eet a bet! A dolar!&#8221; Then he
narrowed his eyes in the direction of the mare. &#8220;Mek eet a good bet! You
have chonce to win, too, Felipe&#8211;you know!&#8221;</p>

<p>Felipe did not respond immediately. Money was his all-absorbing difficulty.
Never plentiful with him, it was less than ever plentiful now, and was wholly
represented in the three dollars before him. A sum little enough in fact, it
dwindled rapidly as he recalled one by one his numerous debts. For he owed much
money. He <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span> owed for
food in the settlement store; he owed for clothing he had bought in town; and he
owed innumerable gambling debts&#8211;big sums, sums mounting to heights he
dared not contemplate. And all he had to his name was the three dollars lying so
peacefully before him, with the speculative Franke hovering over them like a fat
buzzard over a dead coyote. What to do! He could not decide. He had ways for
this money, other than paying on his debts or investing in a gambling
proposition. There was to be a <i>baile</i> soon, and he must buy for Margherita
(providing her father, a caustic <i>hombre</i>, bitter against all wood-haulers,
permitted him the girl&#8217;s society) peanuts in the dance-hall and candy
outside the dance-hall. The candy must be bought in the general store, where,
because of his many debts, he must pay cash now&#8211;always cash! So what to
do! All these things meant money. And money, as he well understood, was a thing
hard to get. Yet here was a chance, as Franke had generously indicated, for him
to win some money. But, against this chance for him to win some money was the
chance also, as conveyed inversely by Franke, of his losing some
money&#8211;money he could ill afford to lose.</p>

<p>&#8220;You afraid?&#8221; suddenly cut in Franke, nastily, upon these
reflections. &#8220;I don&#8217; see you do soomt&#8217;ing!&#8221;</p>

<p>Which decided Felipe for all time. &#8220;Afraid?&#8221; he echoed,
disdainfully. &#8220;Sure! But not for myself! You don&#8217; have mooch money
to lose! But <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span> I mek
eet a bet&#8211;a good bet! I bet you two dolars thot eet&#8211;thot eet
don&#8217; be!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was now the other who hesitated. But he did not hesitate for long.
Evidently the spirit of the gambler was more deeply rooted in him than it was in
Felipe, for, after gazing out in the trail a moment, then eying Felipe another
moment, both speculatively, he extracted from his pockets two more silver
dollars and tossed them down with the others. Then he fixed Felipe with a
malignant stare.</p>

<p>&#8220;I bet you t&#8217;ree dolars thot eet cooms what I haf say!&#8221;</p>

<p>Felipe laughed. &#8220;All right,&#8221; he agreed, readily. &#8220;Why
not?&#8221; He heaped the money under a stone, sank over upon his back with an
affected yawn, drew his hat over his eyes, and lay still. &#8220;We go to sleep
now, Franke,&#8221; he proposed. &#8220;Eet&#8217;s long time&#8211;I haf
t&#8217;ink.&#8221;</p>

<p>Soon both were snoring.</p>

<p>Out in the trail hung the quiet of a sick-room. The long afternoon waned.
Once a wagon appeared from the direction of town, but the driver, evidently
grasping the true situation, turned out and around the mare in respectful
silence. Another time a single horseman, riding from the mountains, cantered
upon the scene; but this man, also with a look of understanding, turned out and
around the mare in careful regard for her condition. Then came darkness. Shadows
crept in from nowhere, stealing over the desert more and more darkly, while,
with their coming, birds <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_11'></a>11</span> of the air, seeking safe place for night rest,
flitted about in nervous uncertainty. And suddenly in the gathering dusk rose
the long-drawn howl of a coyote, lifting into the stillness a lugubrious note of
appeal. Then, close upon the echo of this, rose another appeal in the trail
close by, the shrill nicker of the mate to the mare.</p>

<p>It awoke Felipe. He sat up quickly, rubbed his eyes dazedly, and peered out
with increasing understanding. Then he sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coom!&#8221; he called, kicking the other. &#8220;We go now&#8211;see
who is winnin&#8217; thot bet!&#8221; And he started hurriedly forward.</p>

<p>But the other checked him. &#8220;Wait!&#8221; he snapped, rising. &#8220;You
wait! You in too mooch hurry! You coom back&#8211;I have soomt&#8217;ing!&#8221;</p>

<p>Felipe turned back, wondering. The other nervously produced material for a
cigarette. Then he cleared his throat with needless protraction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Felipe,&#8221; he began, evidently laboring under excitement, &#8220;I
mek eet a <i>bet</i> now! I bet you,&#8221; he went on, his voice trembling with
fervor&#8211;&#8220;I bet you my wagon, thee horses&#8211;thee whole
shutting-match&#8211;against thot wagon and horses yours, and thee
harness&#8211;thee whole damned shutting-match&#8211;thot I haf win!&#8221; He
proceeded to finish his cigarette.</p>

<p>Felipe stared at him hard. Surely his ears had deceived him! If they had not
deceived him, if, for a fact, the <i>hombre</i> had expressed a willingness to
bet all he had on the outcome of this thing, then Franke, fellow-townsman,
<i>compadre</i>, brother-wood-hauler, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_12'></a>12</span> was crazy! But he determined to find out.</p>

<p>&#8220;What you said, Franke?&#8221; he asked, peering into the glowing eyes
of the other. &#8220;Say thot again, <i>hombre</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haf say,&#8221; repeated the other, with lingering emphasis upon
each word&#8211;&#8220;I haf say I bet you everyt&#8217;ing&#8211;wagon, harness,
<i>caballos</i>&#8211;everyt&#8217;ing!&#8211;against thot wagon, harness,
<i>caballos</i> yours&#8211;everyt&#8217;ing&#8211;thee whole
shutting-match&#8211;thot I haf win thee bet!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Felipe lowered his eyes. But now to consider suspicions. He had heard
rightly; Franke really wanted to bet all he had. But he could not but wonder
whether Franke, by any possible chance, knew in advance the outcome of the
affair in the trail. He had heard of such things, though never had he believed
them possible. Yet he found himself troubled with insistent reminder that Franke
had suggested this whole thing. Then suddenly he was gripped in another
unwelcome thought. Could it be possible that this scheming <i>hombre</i>,
awaking at a time when he himself was soundest asleep, had gone out into the
trail on tiptoe for advance information? It was possible. Why not? But that was
not the point exactly. The point was, had he done it? Had this buzzard circled
out into the trail while he himself was asleep? He did not know, and he could
not decide! For the third time in ten hours, though puzzled and groping,
trembling between gain and loss, he plunged on the gambler&#8217;s chance.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>&#8220;All
right!&#8221; he agreed, tensely. &#8220;I take thot bet! I bet you thees wagon,
thees <i>caballos</i>, thees harness&#8211;everyt&#8217;ing&#8211;against everyt&#8217;ing
yours&#8211;wagon, horses, harness&#8211;everyt&#8217;ing! Wait!&#8221; he thundered,
for the other now was striding toward the mare. &#8220;Wait! You in too mooch
hurry yourself now!&#8221; Then, as the other returned: &#8220;Is eet a bet? Is
eet a bet?&#8221;</p>

<p>The fellow-townsman nodded. Whereat Felipe nodded approval of the nod, and
stepped out into the trail, followed by the other.</p>

<p>It was night, and quite a dark night. Stretching away to east and west, the
dimly outlined trail was lost abruptly in engulfing darkness; while, overhead, a
starless sky, low and somber and frowning, pressed close. But, dark though the
night was, it did not wholly conceal the outlines of the mare. She was standing
as they approached, mildly encouraging a tiny something beside her, a wisp of
life, her baby, who was struggling to insure continued existence. And it was
this second outline, not the other and larger outline, that held the breathless
attention of the men. Nervously Felipe struck a match. As it flared up he
stepped close, followed by the other, and there was a moment of tense silence.
Then the match went out and Felipe straightened up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Franke,&#8221; he burst out, &#8220;I haf win thee bet! Eet is not a
mare; eet is a li&#8217;l&#8217; horse!&#8221; He struck his <i>compadre</i> a
resounding blow on the back. &#8220;I am mooch sorry, Franke,&#8221; he
declared&#8211;&#8220;not!&#8221; He turned back to the faint outline of the
colt. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span> &#8220;Thees
<i>potrillo</i>,&#8221; he observed, &#8220;he&#8217;s bringin&#8217; me mooch
good luck! He&#8217;s&#8211;&#8221; He suddenly interrupted himself, aware that
the other was striding away. &#8220;Where you go now, Franke?&#8221; he asked,
and then, quick to sense approaching trouble: &#8220;Never mind thee big bet,
Franke! You can pay me ten dolars soom time! All right?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was painful silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; came the reply, finally, through the darkness.</p>

<p>Then Felipe heard a lumber rigging go rattling off in the direction of the
canyon, and, suddenly remembering the money underneath the stone, hurried off
the trail in a spasm of alarm. He knelt in the sand and struck a match.</p>

<p>The money had disappeared.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span><a id='link_2'></a>CHAPTER II<br /><span class='h2fs'>FELIPE CELEBRATES</span></h2>

<p>It was well along in the morning when Felipe pulled up next day before his
little adobe house in the mountain settlement. The journey from the mesa below
had been, perforce, slow. The mare was still pitiably weak, and her condition
had necessitated many stops, each of long duration. Also, on the way up the
canyon the colt had displayed frequent signs of exhaustion, though only with the
pauses did he attempt rest.</p>

<p>But it was all over now. They were safely before the house, with the colt
lying a little apart from his mother&#8211;regarding her with curious
intentness&#8211;and with Felipe bustling about the team and now and again
bursting out in song of questionable melody and rhythm. Felipe was preparing the
horses for the corral at the rear of the house, and soon he flung aside the
harness and seized each of the horses by the bridle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you li&#8217;l&#8217; devil!&#8221; he exclaimed, addressing the
reclining colt. &#8220;You coom along now! You live in thees place back here!
You coom wit&#8217; me now!&#8221; And he started around a corner of the
adobe.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>The colt hastily
rose to his feet. But not at the command of the man. No such command was
necessary, for whither went his mother there went he. Close to her side, he
moved with her into the inclosure, crowding frantically over the bars, skinning
his knees in the effort, coming to a wide-eyed stand just inside the entrance,
and there surveying with nervous apprehension the corral&#8217;s
occupants&#8211;a burro, two pigs, a flock of chickens. But he held close to his
mother&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>Felipe did not linger in the corral. Throwing off their bridles, he tossed
the usual scant supply of alfalfa to the horses, and filled their tub from a
near-by well. Then, after putting up the bars, he set out with determined stride
across the settlement. His direction was the general store, and his quest was
the loan of a horse, since his team now was broken, and would be broken for a
number of days to come.</p>

<p>The store was owned and conducted by one Pedro Garcia. Pedro Garcia was the
mountain Shylock. He loaned money at enormous rates of interest, and he rented
out horses at prohibitive rates per day. Also, being what he was, Pedro had
gained his pounds of flesh&#8211;was alarmingly fat, with short legs of giant
circumference. Usually these legs were clothed in tight-fitting overalls, and
his small feet incased in boots of high-grade leather wonderfully roweled. Yet
many years had passed since Pedro had been seen in a saddle. Evidently he held
to the rowels in fond memory of his days of <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_17'></a>17</span> slender youth and coltish gambolings. Pedro was
seated in his customary place upon an empty keg on the porch, and Felipe,
ignoring his grunted greeting, plunged at once into the purpose of his call.</p>

<p>He had come to borrow a horse, Felipe explained. One of his own was unfit for
work, yet the cutting and drawing must go on. While the mare was recuperating,
he carefully pointed out, he himself could continue to earn money to meet some
of his pressing debts. Any kind of horse would do, he declared, so long as it
had four legs and was able to carry on the work. The horse need not have a
mouth, even, he added, jocosely, for reasons nobody need explain. After which he
sat down on the porch and awaited the august decision.</p>

<p>Pedro remained silent a long time, the while he moistened his lips with
fitful tongue, and gazed across the tiny settlement reflectively. At length he
drew a deep breath, mixed of disgust and regret, and proceeded to make slow
reply.</p>

<p>It was true, he began, that he had horses to rent. And it was further true,
he went on, deliberately, that he kept them for just this purpose. But&#8211;and
his pause was fraught with deep significance&#8211;it was no less true that
Felipe Montoya bore a bad reputation as a driver of horses&#8211;was known,
indeed, to kill horses through overwork and underfeed&#8211;and that, therefore,
to lend him a horse was like kissing the horse good-by and hitching up another
to the stone-boat. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
Nevertheless, he hastened to add, if Felipe was in urgent need of a horse, and
was prepared to pay the customary small rate per day, and to <i>pay in
advance&#8211;cash&#8211;</i></p>

<p>Here Pedro paused and popped accusing eyes at Felipe, in one strong dramatic
moment before continuing. But he did not continue. Felipe was the check. For
Felipe had leaped to his feet, and now stood brandishing an ugly fist underneath
the proprietor&#8217;s nose. Further&#8211;and infinitely worse&#8211;Felipe was
saying something.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pedro Garcia,&#8221; he began, shrilly, &#8220;I must got a horse! And
I have coom for a horse! And I have thee money to pay for a horse! And if I kill
thot horse,&#8221; he went on, still brandishing his fist&#8211;&#8220;if thot
horse he&#8217;s dropping dead in thee harness&#8211;I pay you for thot horse! I
haf drive horses&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Si, si, si!</i>&#8221; began Pedro, interrupting.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haf drive horses on thees trail ten years!&#8221; persisted Felipe,
yelling, &#8220;and in all thot time, Pedro Garcia, I&#8217;m killin&#8217; only
seven horses, and all seven of thees horses is dyin&#8217;, Pedro Garcia, when I
haf buy them, and I haf buy all seven horses from you, Pedro Garcia, thief and
robber!&#8221; He paused to take a breath. &#8220;And not once, Pedro
Garcia,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;do I keeck about thot-a horse is a horse! But
I haf coom to you before! And I haf coom to you now! I must got a horse quick!
And I bringin&#8217; thot horse back joost thee same as I&#8217;m gettin&#8217;
thot horse&#8211;in good condition&#8211;better&#8211;because everybody is
knowin.&#8217; I <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
feed a horse better than you feed a horse&#8211;and I&#8217;m
<i>cleanin&#8217;</i> the horse once in a while, too!&#8221; Which was a lie,
both as to the feeding and the cleaning, as he well knew, and as, indeed, he
well knew Pedro knew, who, nevertheless, nodded grave assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Si</i>,&#8221; admitted Pedro. &#8220;<i>Pero
ustede&#8211;</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A horse!&#8221; thundered Felipe, interrupting, his neck cords
dangerously distended. &#8220;You give me a horse&#8211;you hear? I want a
horse&#8211;a horse! I don&#8217; coom here for thee talk!&#8221;</p>

<p>Pedro rose hastily from the keg. Also, he grunted quick consent. Then he
stepped inside the store, followed by Felipe, who made several needed purchases,
and, since he had his enemy cowed, and was troubled with thirst created by the
protracted harangue, to say nothing of the strong inclination within him to
celebrate the coming of the colt, he made a purchase that was not needed&#8211;a
bottle of <i>vino</i>, cool and dry from Pedro&#8217;s cellar. With these tucked
securely under his arm, he then calmly informed Pedro of the true state of his
finances, and left the store, returning across the settlement, which lay wrapped
in pulsating noonday quiet. In the shade of his adobe he sat upon the ground,
with his back comfortably against the wall. Directly the quiet was broken by two
distinct sounds&#8211;the pop of a cork out of the neck of a bottle, and the
gurgle of liquid into the mouth of a man.</p>

<p>Thus Felipe set out upon a protracted debauch. In this debauch he did nothing
worth while. He <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span> used
neither the borrowed horse nor his own sound one. Each day saw him redder of eye
and more swollen of lip; each day saw him increasingly heedless of his debts;
each day saw him more neglectful of his duties toward his animals. The one
bottle became two bottles, the two bottles became three, each secured only after
threatened assault upon the body of Pedro, each adding its store to the already
deep conviviality and reckless freedom from all cares now Felipe&#8217;s. He
forgot everything&#8211;forgot the stolen money, forgot the colt, forgot the
needs of the mare&#8211;all in exhilarated pursuit of phantoms.</p>

<p>Yet the colt did not suffer. Becoming ever more confident of himself as the
days passed, he soon revealed pronounced curiosity and an aptitude for play. He
would stare at strutting roosters, gaze after straddling hens, blink quizzically
at the burro, frown upon the grunting pigs, all as if cataloguing these
specimens, listing them in his thoughts, some day to make good use of the
knowledge. But most of all he showed interest in and playfulness toward his
mother and her doings. He would follow her about untiringly, pausing whenever
she paused, starting off again whenever she started off&#8211;seemingly bent
upon acquiring the how and why of her every movement.</p>

<p>But it was his playfulness finally that brought him first needless suffering.
The mare was standing with her nose in the feed-box. She had stood thus many
times during the past week; but usually, before, the box had been empty, whereas
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span> now it contained a
generous quantity of alfalfa. But this the colt did not know. He only knew that
he was interested in this thing, and so went there to attempt, as many times
before, to reach his nose into the mysterious box. Finding that he could not, he
began, as never before, to frisk about the mare, tossing up his little heels and
throwing down his head with all the reckless abandon of a seasoned
&#8220;outlaw.&#8221; He could do these things because he was a rare colt,
stronger than ever colt before was at his age, and for a time the mare suffered
his antics with a look of pleased toleration. But as he kept it up, and as she
was getting her first real sustenance since the day of his coming, she at length
became fretful and sounded a low warning. But this the colt did not heed.
Instead he wheeled suddenly and plunged directly toward her, bunting her
sharply. Nor did the single bunt satisfy him. Again and again he attacked her,
plunging in and darting away each time with remarkable celerity, until, her
patience evidently exhausted, she whisked her head around and nipped him
sharply. Screaming with pain and fright, he plunged from her, sought the
opposite side of the inclosure, and turned upon her a pair of very hurt and
troubled eyes.</p>

<p>Yet all the world over mothers are mothers. After a time&#8211;a long time,
as if to let her punishment sink in&#8211;the mare made her way slowly to the
colt, and there fell to licking him, seeming to tell him of her lasting
forgiveness. Under this lavish caressing the colt, as if to reveal his own <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span> forgiveness for the
dreadful hurt, bestowed similar attention upon her&#8211;in this attention,
though he did not know it, softening flesh that had experienced no such
consideration in years. Thus they stood, side by side, mother and son, long into
the day, laying the foundation of a love that never dies&#8211;that strengthens,
in fact, with the years, though all else fail&#8211;love between mother and her
offspring.</p>

<p>Other things, things of minor consequence, added their mite to his early
development. One morning, while the mare was asleep, the colt, alert and
standing, was startled by the sudden movement of a large rooster. The rooster
had left the ground with loud flapping of wings, and now stood perched upon the
corral fence, like a grim and mighty conqueror, ruffling his neck feathers and
twisting his head in pre-eminent satisfaction. But the colt did not understand
this. Transfixed, he turned frightened eyes upon the cause of the unearthly
commotion. Then suddenly, with another loud flapping of wings, the rooster
uttered a defiant crow, a challenge that echoed far through the canyon. Whereat
the colt, eyes wide with terror, whirled to his mother, whimpering babyishly.
But with the mare standing beside him and caressing him reassuringly, all his
nervousness left him, and he again turned his eyes upon the rooster and watched
him till the cock, unable to stir combat among his neighbors, left the fence
with another loud flapping of wings, and returned to earth, physically and
spiritually, there to set <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_23'></a>23</span> up his customary feigned quest for worms for the
ladies. But the point was this&#8211;with this last flapping of wings the colt
remained in a state of perfect calm.</p>

<p>Thus he learned, and thus he continued to learn, in nervous fear one moment,
in perfect calm the next. And though his hours of life were few indeed, he
nevertheless revealed an intelligence far above the average of his kind. He
learned to avoid the mare&#8217;s whisking tail, to shun or remove molesting
flies, to keep away from the mare when she was at the feed-box. All of which
told of his uncommon strain, as did the rapidity with which he gained strength,
which last told of his tremendous vitality, and which some day would serve him
well against trouble.</p>

<p>Yet in it all lurked the great mystery, and Felipe, blustering to occasional
natives outside the fence during his week of debauch, while pointing out with
pride the colt&#8217;s very evident blooded lineage, yet could tell nothing of
that descent. All he could point out was that the mare was chestnut-brown, and
when not in harness was kept close within the confines of the corral, while here
was a colt of a dark-fawn color which would develop with maturity into
coal-black. And there was not a single black horse in the mountains for miles
and miles around. Nor was the colt a &#8220;throw-back,&#8221;
because&#8211;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; he would conclude, casting bleared eyes in the
direction of the house, wearily, &#8220;I got soom <i>vino</i> inside. You coom
along now. We go <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
gettin&#8217; a drink.&#8221; Which would close the monologue.</p>

<p>One morning early, Felipe, asleep on a bed that never was made up, heard
suspicious sounds in the corral outside. He sprang up and, clad only in a
fiery-red undershirt, hurried to a window. Cautiously letting down the bars,
with a rope already tied around the colt&#8217;s neck, was the mountain Shylock,
Pedro Garcia, intent upon leading off the innocent new-comer. Pedro no doubt had
perceived an opportunity either to force Felipe to meet some of his debts, or
else hold the colt as a very acceptable chattel. Also, he evidently had
calculated upon early dawn as the time best suited to do this thing, in view of
Felipe&#8217;s long debauch upon unpaid-for wine. At any rate, there he was,
craftily letting down the bars. Raging with indignation and a natural venom
which he felt toward the storekeeper, Felipe flung up the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Buenos dias, señor!</i>&#8221; he greeted, cheerfully, with effort
controlling his anger. &#8220;Thee early worm he&#8217;s takin&#8217; thee
<i>potrillo</i>! How cooms thot, <i>señor</i>?&#8221; he asked, enjoying the
other&#8217;s sudden discomfiture. &#8220;You takin&#8217; thot li&#8217;l&#8217;
horse for thee walk&#8211;thee exercise?&#8221; And then, without waiting for a
reply, had there been one forthcoming, which there was not, he slammed down the
window, leaped to the door, flung it open&#8211;all levity now gone from him.
&#8220;Pedro Garcia!&#8221; he raged. &#8220;You thief and robber! I&#8217;m
killin&#8217; you thees time sure!&#8221; And, regardless of his scant <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span> attire, and stringing out
a volley of oaths, he sprang out of the doorway after his intended victim.</p>

<p>But Pedro Garcia, though fat, was surprisingly quick on his feet. He dropped
the rope and burst into a run, heading frantically past the house toward the
trail. And, though Felipe leaped after him, still clad only in fiery-red
undershirt, the storekeeper gained the trail and set out at top speed across the
settlement. Felipe pursued. Hair aflaunt, shirt-tail whipping in the breeze,
bare feet paddling in the dust of the trail, naked legs crossing each other like
giant scissors in frenzied effort, he hurtled forward exactly one leap behind
his intended victim. He strained to close up the gap, but he could not overtake
the equally speedy Pedro, whose short legs fairly buzzed in the terror of their
owner. Thus they ran, mounting the slight rise before the general store, then
descending into the heart of the settlement, with Pedro whipping along
frantically, and Felipe still one whole leap behind, until a derisive shout, a
feminine exclamation of shrieking glee, awoke Felipe to the spectacle he was
making of himself before the eyes of the community. He stopped; growled
disappointed rage; darted back along the trail. Once in the privacy of his
house, he hurriedly donned his clothes and gave himself over to deliberations.
The result of these deliberations was that he concluded to return to work.</p>

<p>After a scant breakfast of chili and coffee he <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span> moved out to the corral. He leaned his
arms upon the fence and surveyed the colt with fresh interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thot li&#8217;l&#8217; <i>caballo</i>,&#8221; he began, &#8220;he&#8217;s
bringin&#8217; me mooch good luck. Thot <i>potrillo</i> he&#8217;s wort&#8217;
seven&#8211;he&#8217;s wort&#8217;&#8211;<i>si</i>&#8211;eight dolars&#8211;thot
<i>potrillo</i>. I t&#8217;ink I haf sell heem, too&#8211;queek&#8211;in town! But
first I must go cuttin&#8217; thee wood!&#8221; With this he let down the bars
and entered the inclosure. Then his thoughts took an abrupt turn. &#8220;I keel
thot Pedro Garcia soomtime&#8211;bet you&#8217; life! He&#8217;s stealin&#8217;
fleas off a dog&#8211;thot <i>hombre</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Felipe drove the borrowed horse out of the inclosure, and then singled out
the mate to the mare. As he harnessed up this horse, the colt, standing close
by, revealed marked interest. Also, as Felipe led the horse out of the corral
the colt followed till shut off by the bars, which Felipe hurriedly put up. But
they did not discourage him. He remained very close to them, peering out between
the while Felipe hitched the team to his empty lumber rigging. Then came the
crack of a whip, loud creaking of greaseless wheels, the voice of Felipe in
lusty demand, all as the outfit set out up the trail toward the timber-slopes.
But not till the earth was still again, the cloud of dust in the trail
completely subsided, did the colt turn away from the bars and seek his mother,
and then with a look in his soft-blinking eyes that told of concentrated
pondering on these mysteries of life.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span><a id='link_3'></a>CHAPTER III<br /><span class='h2fs'>A SURPRISE</span></h2>

<p>Next morning, having returned from the timber-slopes, Felipe, fresh and
radiant, appeared outside the corral in holiday attire. Part of this attire was
a pair of brand-new overalls. Indeed, the overalls were so new that they
crackled; and Felipe appeared quite conscious of their newness, for he let down
the bars with great care, and with even greater care stepped into the inclosure.
Then it was seen, since he was a Mexican who ran true to form, there was a flaw
in all this splendor. For he had drawn on the new overalls over the older
pair&#8211;worse, had drawn them on over <i>two</i> older pairs, as revealed at
the bottoms, where peered plaintively two shades of blue&#8211;lighter blue of
the older pair, very light blue of the oldest pair&#8211;the effect of exposure
to desert suns. So Felipe had on three pairs of overalls. Yet this was not all
of distinction. Around his brown throat was a bright red neckerchief, while
between the unbuttoned edges of his vest was an expanse of bright
green&#8211;the coloring of a tight-fitting sweater.</p>

<p>There was reason for all this. Felipe was going to town, and he was taking
the mare along with <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
him, and the mare naturally would take her colt; and because he had come to know
the value of the colt, Felipe wished to appear as prosperous in the eyes of the
Americans in town as he believed the owner of so fine a colt ought to
appear.</p>

<p>Therefore, still careful of his overalls, he set about leisurely to prepare
the team for the journey. He crossed to the shed, hauled out the harness, tossed
it out into the inclosure. Promptly both horses stepped into position. Also, the
older mare, whether through relief or regret, sounded a shrill nicker. This
brought the colt to her side, where he fell to licking her affectionately,
showing his great love for her bony frame. And when Felipe led the horses out of
the corral he followed close beside her, and when outside held close to her
throughout the hitching, and to the point even when Felipe clambered to the top
of the high load and caught up the reins and the whip. Then he stepped back,
wriggling his fuzzy little tail and blinking his big eyes curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, <i>potrillo</i>,&#8221; began Felipe, grinning down upon the
tiny specimen of life, &#8220;we goin&#8217; now to town! But first you must be
ready! You ready? All right! We go now!&#8221; And he cracked the whip over the
team.</p>

<p>They started forward, slowly at first, the wagon giving off many creaks and
groans, then fast and faster, until, well in the descent of the hard canyon
trail, the horses were jogging along quite briskly.</p>

<p>The colt showed the keenest interest and delight. <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span> For a time he trotted beside the mare,
ears cocked forward expectantly, eyes sweeping the canyon alertly, hoofs lifting
to ludicrous heights. Then, as the first novelty wore off, and he became more
certain of himself in these swift-changing surroundings, he revealed a
playfulness that tickled Felipe. He would lag behind a little, race madly
forward, sometimes run far ahead of the team in his great joy. But he seemed
best to like to lag. He would come to a sudden stop and, motionless as a dog
pointing a bird, gaze out across the canyon a long time, like one trying to find
himself in a strange and wonderful world. Or, standing thus, he would reveal
curious interest in the rocks and stumps around him, and he would stare at them
fixedly, blinking slowly, a look of genuine wonderment in his big, soft eyes.
Then he would strain himself mightily to overtake the wagon.</p>

<p>Once in a period of absorbed attention he lost sight of the outfit
completely. This was due not so much to his distance in the rear as to the fact
that the wagon, having struck a bend in the trail, had turned from view. But he
did not know that. Sounding a baby outcry of fear, he scurried ahead at
breakneck speed, frantic heels tossing up tiny spurts of dust, head stretched
forward&#8211;and thus soon caught up. After that he remained close beside his
mother until the wagon, rocking down the mouth of the canyon, swung out upon the
broad mesa. Here the outfit could be seen for miles, and now he took to lagging
behind again, and to frisking far ahead, always returning at frequent <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span> intervals for the motherly
assurance that all was well.</p>

<p>As part of the Great Scheme, all this was good for him. In his brief panic
when out of sight of his mother he was taught how very necessary she was to his
existence. In his running back and forth, with now and again breathless
speeding, he developed the muscles of his body, to the end that later he might
well take up an independent fight for life. In the curious interest he displayed
in all subjects about him he lent unknowing assistance to a spiritual
development as necessary as physical development. All this prepared him to meet
men and measures as he was destined to meet them&#8211;with gentleness, with
battle,&#8211;with affection&#8211;like for like&#8211;as he found it. It was
all good for him, this movement, this change of environment, this quick
awakening of interest. It shaped him in both body and spirit to the Great
Purpose.</p>

<p>This interest seemed unbounded. Whenever a jack-rabbit shot across the trail,
or a covey of birds broke from the sand-hills, he would come to a quick pause
and blink curiously, seeming to understand and approve, and to be grateful, as
if all these things were done for him. Also, with each halt Felipe made with
<i>compadres</i> along the trail, friends who entered with him in loud badinage
over the ownership of the colt&#8211;an ownership all vigorously denied
him&#8211;the colt himself would cock his ears and fix his eyes, seemingly aware
of his importance and pleased to be the object of <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span> the cutting remarks. And thus the miles
from mountain to the outskirts of town were covered, miles pleasurable to him,
every inch revealing something of fresh interest, every mile finding him more
accustomed to the journey.</p>

<p>They reached a point on the outskirts where streets appeared, sharply defined
thoroughfares, interlacing one with the other. And as they advanced vehicles
began to turn in upon the trail, a nondescript collection ranging from an Indian
farm-wagon off the Navajo reservation to the north to a stanhope belonging to
some more affluent American in the suburbs. With them came also many strange
sounds&#8211;Mexican oaths, mild Indian commands, light man-to-man greetings of
the day. Also there was much cracking of whips and nickering of horses along the
line. And the result of all this was that the colt revealed steadily increasing
nervousness, a condition enhanced by the fact that his mother, held rigidly to
her duties by Felipe, could bestow upon her offspring but very little attention.
But he held close to her, and thus moved into the heart of town, when suddenly
one by one the vehicles ahead came to a dead stop. Felipe, perched high, saw
that the foremost wagons had reached the railroad crossing, and that there was a
long freight-train passing through.</p>

<p>Team after team came into the congestion and stopped. Cart and wagon and
phaeton closed in around the colt. There was much maneuvering for space. The
colt&#8217;s nervousness increased, and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_32'></a>32</span> became positive fear. He darted wild eyes about him.
He was completely hedged in. On his right loomed a large horse; behind him stood
a drowsing team; on his left was a dirt-cart; while immediately in front, such
was his position now, stood his mother. But, though gripped in fear, he remained
perfectly still until the locomotive, puffing and wheezing along at the rear of
the train, having reached the crossing, sounded a piercing shriek. This was more
than he could stand. Without a sound he dodged and whirled. He plunged to the
rear and rammed into the drowsing team; darted to the right and into the teeth
of the single horse; whirled madly to the left, only to carom off the hub of a
wheel. But with all this defeat he did not stop. He set up a wild series of
whirling plunges, and, completely crazed now, darted under the single horse,
under a Mexican wagon, under a team of horses, and forth into a little clearing.
Here he came to a stop, trembling in every part, gazing about in wildest
terror.</p>

<p>Following its shrill blast, the engine puffed across the crossing, the gates
slowly lifted, and the foremost vehicles began to move. Soon the whole line was
churning up clouds of dust and rattling across the railroad tracks. Felipe was
of this company, cracking his whip and yelling lustily, enjoying the congestion
and this unexpected opportunity to be seen by so many American eyes at once in
his gorgeous raiment. In the town proper, and carefully avoiding the more
rapidly moving vehicles, he turned off the avenue into a <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span> narrow side street, and pulled up at a
water-trough. As he dropped the reins and prepared to descend, a friend of
his&#8211;and he had many&#8211;hailed him from the sidewalk. Hastily clambering
down, he seized the man&#8217;s arm in forceful greeting, and indicated with a
jerk of his head a near-by saloon.</p>

<p>&#8220;We go gettin&#8217; soomt&#8217;ing,&#8221; he invited. &#8220;I have munch
good luck to tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Inside the establishment Felipe became loquacious and boasting. He now was a
man of comfortable wealth, he gravely informed his friend&#8211;a wizened
individual with piercing eyes. Besides winning a bet of fifteen dollars in
money, he explained, he also held a note against Franke Gamboa for fifty dollars
more on his property. But that was not all. Aside from the note and the cash in
hand, he was the owner of a colt now of great value&#8211;<i>si</i>&#8211;worth
at least ten dollars&#8211;which, added to the other, made him, as anybody could
see, worthy of recognition. With this he placed his empty glass down on the bar
and swung over into English.</p>

<p>&#8220;You haf hear about thot?&#8221; he asked, drawing the back of his hand
across his mouth. Then, as the other shook his head negatively, &#8220;Well, I
haf new one&#8211;<i>potrillo</i>&#8211;nice li&#8217;l&#8217;
horse&#8211;<i>si</i>!&#8221; He cleared his throat and frowned at the listening
bartender. &#8220;He&#8217;s comin&#8217; couple days before, oop on thee
mesa.&#8221; He picked up the glass, noted that it was empty, placed it down
again. &#8220;I&#8217;m sellin&#8217; thot <i>potrillo</i> quick,&#8221; he went
on&#8211;&#8220;bet you&#8217; life! <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_34'></a>34</span> I feed heem couple weeks more mebbe&#8211;feed heem
beer and soom cheese!&#8221; He laughed raucously at the alleged witticism.
&#8220;Thot&#8217;s thee preencipal t&#8217;ing,&#8221; he declared, soberly.
&#8220;You must feed a horse.&#8221; He said this not as one recommending that a
horse be well fed, but as one advising that a horse be given something to eat
occasionally. &#8220;<i>Si!</i> Thot&#8217;s thee preencipal t&#8217;ing! Then
he&#8217;s makin&#8217; a fast goer&#8211;bet you&#8217; life! I haf give
heem&#8211;&#8221; He suddenly interrupted himself and laid firm hold upon the
man&#8217;s arm. &#8220;You coom wit&#8217; me!&#8221; he invited, and began to
drag the other toward the swing-doors. &#8220;You coom look at thot
<i>potrillo</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>They went outside. On the curb, Felipe gazed about him, first with a look of
pride, then with an expression of blank dismay. He stepped down off the curb,
roused the drowsing mare with a vigorous clap, again looked about him worriedly.
After a long moment he left the team, walking out into the middle of the street,
and strained his eyes in both directions. Then he returned and, heedless of his
new overalls, got down upon his knees, sweeping bleared eyes under the wagon.
And finally, with a last despairing gaze in every direction, he sat down upon
the curb and buried his face in his arms.</p>

<p>For the colt was gone!</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><span class='h2fs'>A NEW HOME</span></h2>

<p>With the beginning of the forward movement across the railroad the colt, ears
cocked and eyes alert, moved across also. Close about him stepped other horses,
and over and around him surged a low murmuring, occasionally broken by the crack
of a whip. Yet these sounds did not seem to disturb him. He trotted along,
crossing the tracks, and when on the opposite side set out straight down the
avenue. The avenue was broad, and in this widening area the congestion rapidly
thinned, and soon the colt was quite alone in the open. But he continued
forward, seeming not to miss his mother, until there suddenly loomed up beside
him a very fat and very matronly appearing horse. Then he hesitated, turning
apprehensive eyes upon her. But not for long. Evidently accepting this horse as
his mother, he fell in close beside her and trotted along again in perfect
composure.</p>

<p>Behind this horse was a phaeton, and in the phaeton sat two persons. They
were widely different in age. One was an elderly man, broad of shoulders and
with a ruddy face faintly threaded <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_36'></a>36</span> with purple; the other was a young girl, not more
than seventeen, his daughter, with a face sweet and alert, and a mass of
chestnut hair&#8211;all imparting a certain esthetic beauty. Like the man, the
girl was ruddy of complexion, though hers was the bloom of youth, while his was
toll taken from suns and winds of the desert. The girl was the first to discover
the colt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daddy!&#8221; she exclaimed, placing a restraining hand upon the
other. &#8220;Whose beautiful colt is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Judge pulled down his horse and leaned far out over the side. &#8220;Why,
I don&#8217;t know, dear!&#8221; he replied, after a moment, then turned his
eyes to the rear. &#8220;He must belong with some team in that crush.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl regarded the colt with increasing rapture. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t he a
perfect dear!&#8221; she went on. &#8220;Look at him, daddy!&#8221; she suddenly
urged, delightedly. &#8220;He&#8217;s dying to know why we stopped!&#8221;
Which, indeed, the colt looked to be, since he had come to a stop with the mare
and now was regarding them curiously. &#8220;I&#8217;d love to pet
him!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Judge frowned. &#8220;We&#8217;re late for luncheon,&#8221; he declared,
and again gazed to the rear. &#8220;We&#8217;d better take him along with us out
to the ranch. To-morrow I&#8217;ll advertise him in the papers.&#8221; And he
shook up the mare. &#8220;We&#8217;d better go along, Helen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just one minute, daddy!&#8221; persisted the girl, gathering up her
white skirts and, as the Judge pulled down, leaping lightly out of the phaeton.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span> &#8220;I&#8217;ve
simply <i>got</i> to pet him!&#8221; She cautiously approached the colt.</p>

<p>He permitted her this approach. Nor did he shy at her outstretched hand.
Under her gentle caresses he stood very still, and when she stooped before him,
as she did presently, bringing her eyes upon a level with his own, he gazed into
them very frankly and earnestly, as if gauging this person, as he had seemed to
tabulate all other things, some day to make good use of his knowledge. After a
time the girl spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could keep you always,&#8221; she said, poutingly. &#8220;You
look so nice and babyish!&#8221; But she knew that she could not keep him, and
after a time she stood up again and sighed, and fell to stroking him
thoughtfully. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have you to-day, anyway,&#8221; she declared,
finally, with promise of enjoyment in her voice, as one who meant to make the
most of it. Then she got back into the phaeton.</p>

<p>The Judge started up the horse again. They continued through the town, and
when on its northwestern outskirts turned to the right along a trail that
paralleled the river. The trail ran north and south, and on either side of it,
sometimes shielding a secluded ranch, always forming an agreeable oasis in the
flat brown of the country, rose an occasional clump of cottonwoods. The
ranch-houses were infrequent, however; all of them were plentifully supplied
with water by giant windmills which clacked and creaked above the trees in the
high-noon breeze. To the left, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_38'></a>38</span> across the river, back from the long, slow rise of
sand from the water&#8217;s edge, rose five blunt heights like craters long
extinct; while above these, arching across the heavens in spotless sheen, curved
the turquoise dome of a southwestern midday sky, flooding the dust and dunes
below in throbbing heat-rays. It was God&#8217;s own section of earth, and not
the least beautiful of its vistas, looming now steadily ahead on their right,
was the place belonging to Judge Richards. House and outhouses white, and just
now aglint in the white light of the sun, the whole ranch presented the
appearance of diamonds nestling in a bed of emerald-green velvet. Turning off at
this ranch, the Judge tossed the reins to a waiting Mexican.</p>

<p>Helen was out of the phaeton like a flash. Carefully guiding the colt around
the house and across a <i>patio</i>, she turned him loose into a spacious
corral. Then she fell to watching him, and she continued to watch him until a
voice from the house, that of an aged Mexican woman who presided over the
kitchen, warned her that dinner was waiting. Reluctantly hugging the
colt&#8211;hugging him almost savagely in her sudden affection for him&#8211;she
then turned to leave, but not without a word of explanation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must leave you now, honey!&#8221; she said, much as a child would
take leave of her doll. &#8220;But I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t be away from you long,
and when I come back I&#8217;ll see what I can do about feeding you!&#8221;</p>

<p>The colt stood for a time, peering between the <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span> corral boards after her. Then he set out
upon a round of investigation. He moved slowly along the inside of the fence,
seeming to approve its whitewashed cleanliness, until, turning in a corner, he
stood before the stable door. Here he paused a moment, gazing into the
semi-gloom, then sprang up the one step. Inside, he stood another moment,
sweeping eyes down past the stalls, and finally set out and made his way to the
far end. In the stall next the last stood a brown saddle-horse, and in the last
stall the matronly horse he had followed out from town. But he showed no
interest in these, bestowing upon each merely a passing glance. Then,
discovering that the flies bothered him here more than in the corral, he walked
back to the door and out into the sunlight again. In the corral he took up his
motionless stand in the corner nearest the house.</p>

<p>He did not stand thus for long. He soon revealed grave uneasiness. It was due
to a familiar gnawing inside. He knew the relief for this, and promptly set out
in search of his mother. He hurried back along the fence, gained the door of the
stable, and stepped into the stable, this time upon urgent business. He trotted
down past the stalls to the family horse, and without hesitation stepped in
alongside of her. Directly there was a shrill nicker, a lightning flash of
heels, and the colt lay sprawling on the stable floor.</p>

<p>Never was there a colt more astonished than this one. Dazed, trembling, he
regained his feet and looked at the mare, looked hard. Then casting <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span> solicitous eyes in the
direction of the saddle-horse, he stepped in alongside. But here he met with
even more painful objections. The horse reached around and bit him sharply in
the neck. It hurt, hurt awfully, but he persisted, only to receive another sharp
bite, this time more savage. Sounding a baby whimper of despair, he ran back to
the door and out into the motherless corral.</p>

<p>He made for the corner nearest the house. But he did not stand still. He
cocked his ears, pawed the ground, turned again and again, swallowed frequently.
And presently he set out once more in search of his mother; though this time he
wisely kept out of the stable. He held close to the fence, following it around
and around, pausing now and again with eyes strained between the boards. But he
could not find his mother. Finally, resorting to the one effort left to him that
might bring result, he flung up his little head and sounded a piteous
call&#8211;not once, but many times.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunty,&#8221; declared the girl, rushing into the genial presence of
the Mexican cook, &#8220;what shall I do about that colt? He must be
hungry!&#8221;</p>

<p>The old woman nodded and smiled knowingly. Then she stepped into the pantry.
She filled a long-necked bottle with milk and sugar and a dash of lime-water,
and, placing the bottle in the girl&#8217;s hands, shoved her gently out the
door and into the <i>patio</i>.</p>

<p>Racing across to the corral, Helen reached the colt with much-needed aid. He
closed upon the bottle with an eagerness that seemed to tell he <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span> had known no other method
of feeding. Also, he clung to it till the last drop was gone, which caused Helen
to wonder when last the colt had fed. Then, as if by way of reward for this
kindly attention, he tossed his head suddenly, striking the bottle out of her
hands. This was play; and Helen, girlishly delighted, sprang toward him. He
leaped away, however, and, coming to a stand at a safe distance, wriggled his
ears at her mischievously. She sprang toward him again; but again he darted
away. Whereupon she raced after him, pursuing him around the inclosure, the colt
frisking before her, kicking up his heels and nickering shrilly, until, through
breathlessness, she was forced to stop. Then the colt stopped, and after a time,
having regarded her steadfastly, invitingly, he seemed to understand, for he
quietly approached her. As he came close she stooped before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Honey dear,&#8221; she began, eyes on a level with his own,
&#8220;they have telephoned the city officials, and your case will be advertised
to-morrow in the papers. But I do wish that I could keep you.&#8221; She peered
into his slow-blinking eyes thoughtfully. &#8220;Brownie&#8211;my
saddle-horse&#8211;is all stable-ridden, and I need a good saddler. And some day
you would be grown, and I could&#8211;could take lots of comfort with
you.&#8221; She was silent. &#8220;Anyway,&#8221; she concluded, rising and
stroking him absently, &#8220;we&#8217;ll see. Though I hope&#8211;and I know it
isn&#8217;t a bit right&#8211;that nothing comes of the advertisement; or, if
something does come of it, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_42'></a>42</span> that your rightful owner will prove willing to sell
you after a time.&#8221; With this she picked up the bottle and left him.</p>

<p>And nothing did come of the advertisement. Felipe did not read the papers,
and his knowledge of city affairs was such that he did not set up intelligent
quest for the colt.</p>

<p>So the colt remained in the Richards&#8217; corral. Regularly two and three
times a day the girl came to feed him, and regularly as his reward each time he
bunted the bottle out of her hand afterward. Also, between meals she spent much
time in his society, and on these occasions relieved the tedium of his diet with
loaf sugar, and, after a while, quartered apples. For these sweets he soon
developed a passion, and he would watch her comings with a feverish anxiety that
always brought a smile to her ready lips. And thus began, and thus went on,
their friendship, a friendship that with the passing months ripened into
strongest attachment, but which presently was to be interrupted for a long
time.</p>

<p>Hint of this came to him gradually. From spending long periods with him every
day his mistress, after each feeding now, took to hurrying away from him.
Sometimes, so great was her haste to get back to the house, she actually ran out
of the corral. It worried him, and he would follow her to the gate, and there
stand with nose between the boards and eyes turned after her, whimpering softly.
And finally, with his bottle displaced by more solid food, and the visits of his
mistress <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span> becoming
less frequent, he awoke to certain mysterious arrivals and departures in a buggy
of a sharp-eyed woman all in black, and he came to feel, by reason of his
super-animal instinct, that something of a very grave nature was about to happen
to him. Then one morning late in August he experienced that which made his fears
positive convictions, though precisely what it was he did not immediately
know.</p>

<p>His mistress stepped into the corral with her usual briskness, and, walking
deliberately past him, turned up an empty box in a far corner and sat down upon
it, and called to him. From the instant of her entrance he had held himself
back, but when she called him he rushed eagerly to her side. She placed her arms
around his neck, drew his head down into her lap, and proceeded to unfold a
story&#8211;later, tearful.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all settled,&#8221; she began, with a restful sigh.
&#8220;We have discussed it for weeks, and I&#8217;ve had a dreadful time of it,
and aunty&#8211;my Mexican aunty, you know&#8211;and my other aunty, my regular
aunty&#8211;I have no mother&#8211;and everybody&#8211;got so excited I
didn&#8217;t really know them for my own, and daddy flared up a little,
and&#8211;and&#8211;&#8221; She paused and sighed again. &#8220;But finally they
let me have my own way about it&#8211;though daddy called it &#8216;infant
tommyrot&#8217;&#8211;and so here it is!&#8221; She tilted up his head and
looked into his eyes. &#8220;You, sir,&#8221; she then went on&#8211;&#8220;you,
sir, from this day and date&#8211;I reckon that is how daddy would say
it&#8211;you, sir, from this day and date <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_44'></a>44</span> shall be known as Pat. Your name, sir, is
Pat&#8211;P-a-t&#8211;Pat! I don&#8217;t know whether you like it or not, of
course! But I do know that I like it, and under the circumstances I reckon
that&#8217;s all that is necessary.&#8221; Then came the tears. &#8220;But that
isn&#8217;t all, Pat dear,&#8221; she went on, tenderly. &#8220;I have something
else to tell you, though it hurts dreadfully for me to do it. But&#8211;but
I&#8217;m going away to school. I&#8217;m going East, to be gone a long time. I
want to go, though,&#8221; she added, gazing soberly into his eyes; &#8220;yet I
am afraid to leave you alone with Miguel. Miguel doesn&#8217;t like to have you
around, and I know it, and I am afraid he will be cruel to you. But&#8211;but
I&#8217;ve got to go now. The dressmaker has been coming for over a month;
and&#8211;and I&#8217;m not even coming home for vacation. I am to visit
relatives, or something, in New York&#8211;or somewhere&#8211;and the whole
thing is arranged. But I&#8211;I don&#8217;t seem to want&#8211;to&#8211;to go
away now!&#8221; Which was where the tears fell. &#8220;If things&#8211;things
could only be&#8211;be put off! But I&#8211;I know they can&#8217;t!&#8221; She
was silent, silent a long time, gazing off toward the distant mountains through
tear-bedimmed eyes. &#8220;But when I do come back,&#8221; she concluded,
finally, brightening, &#8220;you will have grown to a great size, Pat dear, and
then we can go up on the mesa and ride and ride. Can&#8217;t we?&#8221; And she
hugged him convulsively. &#8220;It will be glorious. Won&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>He didn&#8217;t exactly say. His interest was elsewhere, and, resisting her
hugging, he began to <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
nuzzle her hands for sweets. Whereupon she burst into laughter and forcibly
hugged him again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I forgot,&#8221; she declared, regretfully. &#8220;You shall have
them, though&#8211;right away!&#8221; Then she arose and left him&#8211;left him
a very much mystified colt. But when she returned with what he sought he looked
his delight, and closed over the sweets with an eagerness that forced her into
sober reflection. &#8220;Pat,&#8221; she said, after a time, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t think you care one single bit for me! All you care about, I&#8217;ll
bet, is what I bring you to eat!&#8221; Then she began to stroke him.
&#8220;Just the same,&#8221; she concluded, after a while, tenderly,
&#8220;you&#8217;re the dearest colt that ever lived!&#8221; She dallied with
him a moment longer, then abruptly left him, running back to the house.</p>

<p>The days which followed, however, were full of delight for him. Now that the
mysterious activity in the house was over with, his mistress began to visit him
again with more than frequent regularity. And with each visit she would remain
with him a long time, caressing him, talking to him, as had been her wont in the
earlier days of their friendship. But as against those earlier days he had
changed. Possibly this was due to her absence. Instead of frisking about the
inclosure now, as he had used to frisk&#8211;whirling madly from her in
play&#8211;he would remain very still during her visits, standing motionless
under her caresses and love-talk. Also, when she took herself off each time,
instead of hurrying frantically after her to the gate, he would walk slowly,
even <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span> sedately, into
his corner, the one nearest the house, and there watch her soberly till she
disappeared indoors. Then&#8211;further evidence of the change that had come
upon him&#8211;he would lie down in the warm sunlight and there fight flies,
although before he had been given to worrying the family horse or irritating the
brown saddler&#8211;all with nervous playfulness.</p>

<p>And he was dozing in his corner that morning when his mistress came
fluttering to him to say good-by. He slowly rose to his feet and blinked
curiously at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pat dear,&#8221; she exclaimed, breathlessly, &#8220;I&#8217;m going
now!&#8221; She flung her arms around his neck, held him tightly to her a
moment, then stepped back. &#8220;You&#8211;you must be good while&#8211;while
I&#8217;m gone!&#8221; And dashing away a persistent tear, she then hurriedly
left him, speeding across the <i>patio</i> and stepping into the waiting
phaeton.</p>

<p>He watched the vehicle roll out into the trail. And though he did not
understand, though the seriousness of it all was denied him, he nevertheless
remained close to the fence a long time; long after the phaeton had passed from
view, long after the sound of the mare&#8217;s paddling feet had died away, he
stood there, ears cocked, eyes wide, tail motionless, in an attitude of
receptivity, spiritual absorption, as one flicked with unwelcome
premonitions.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span><a id='link_5'></a>CHAPTER V<br /><span class='h2fs'>LONELINESS</span></h2>

<p>Pat&#8217;s mistress was gone. He realized it from his continued disappointed
watching for her at the fence; he realized it from the utter absence out of life
of the sweets he had learned to love so well; and he realized it most of all
from the change which rapidly came over the Mexican hostler. Though he did not
know it, Miguel had been instructed, and in no mistakable language, to take good
care of him, and, among other things, to keep him healthily supplied with
sweets. But Miguel was not interested in colts, much less in anything that meant
additional labor for him, and so Pat was made to suffer. Yet in this, as in all
the other things, lay a wonderful good. He was made to know that he was not
wholly a pampered thing&#8211;was made to feel the other side of life, the side
of bitterness and disappointment, the side at times of actual want. And this
continued denial of wants, of needs, occasionally, hardened him, as his earlier
experiences had hardened him, toughened him for the struggles to come, brought
to him that which is good for all youth&#8211;realization that life is not a
mere span <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span> of days
with sweets and comforts for the asking, but a time of struggle, a battle for
supremacy, and it is only through the battle that one grows fit and ever more
fit for the good of the All.</p>

<p>Not the least of his trials was great loneliness. One day was so very like
another. Regularly each morning, after seeking out his favorite corner in the
corral, he would see the sun step from the mountain-tops, ascend through a cool
morning, pour down scorching midday rays, descend through a tense afternoon, and
drop from view in the chill of evening. Always he would watch this thing,
sometimes standing, other times reclining, but ever conscious of the dread
monotony of it all. Nothing happened, nobody came to caress him, no one paid him
the least attention. A forlorn colt, a lonely colt, doubly so for lack of a
mother, he spent long days in moody contemplation of an existence that
irked.</p>

<p>One day, however, came something of interest into the monotony of his life.
Evidently tiring of attending each horse in turn in the stalls, Miguel built a
general box for feed in one corner of the inclosure, and then, by dint of loud
swearing and the free use of a pitchfork, instructed the colt to feed from it
with the others. Not that Pat required instruction as to the feeding
itself&#8211;he was too much alive to need driving in that respect. But he did
show nervous timidity at feeding with the other horses, and so Miguel cheerfully
went to the urging with fork and tongue. But only <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span> the one time. Soon the colt took to
burying his nose in the box along with the others, and would wriggle his tail
with a vigor that seemed to tell of his gratitude at being accepted as part of
the great establishment and its devices. And then another thing. With this
change in his method of feeding, he soon came to reveal steadily increasing
courage and independence. Oftentimes he would be the first to reach the box,
and, what was more to the point, would hold his position against the other
horses&#8211;hold it against rough shouldering from the family horse, savage
nipping from the saddler, even vigorous cursing and flaying from the swarthy
hostler.</p>

<p>With the approach of winter he revealed his courage and temerity further. Of
his own volition one night he abruptly changed his sleeping-quarters. Since the
memorable occasion when the mare had kicked him out of her stall he had sought
out a stall by himself with the coming of night, and there spent the hours in
fear-broken sleep. But this night, and every night thereafter, saw him boldly
approaching the mare and crowding in beside her in her stall, where, in the
contact with her warm body and in her silent presence, he found much that was
soothing and comfortable. Which, too, marked the beginning of a new friendship,
one that steadily ripened with the passing winter and, by the time spring again
descended into the valley, was an attachment close almost as that between mother
and offspring. When in his playful moments, rare indeed now <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span> for one of his age, he would
inadvertently plunge into her, or stumble over a water-pail, she would nicker
grave disapproval, or else chide him more generously by licking his neck and
withers a long time in genuine affection.</p>

<p>Thus the colt changed in both spirit and physique. And the more he changed,
and the larger he grew, the greater source of trouble he became to the Mexican.
Before, he had feared the man. Now he felt only a kind of hatred, and this lent
courage to make of himself a frequent source of annoyance.</p>

<p>With the return of warm weather he resumed his old place in his favorite
corner. He did this through both habit and a desire to warm himself in the
sun&#8217;s rays. And it was all innocent enough&#8211;this thing. Yet, innocent
though it was, more than once, in passing, the Mexican struck him with whatever
happened to be in his hands. At such times, whimpering with pain, he would dart
to an opposite corner, there to stand in trembling fear, until, his courage
returning, and his hatred for the man upholding him, he would return and
defiantly resume his day-dreaming in the corner. This happened for perhaps a
dozen times before he openly rebelled. And when he did rebel&#8211;when the
Mexican struck him sharply across the nose&#8211;he whipped around his head like
lightning and, still only half awake, sank his teeth savagely into the
man&#8217;s shoulder. Followed a string of oaths and sudden appearance of a
club, which might have proved serious but for the Judge&#8217;s timely <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span> call for the horse and
phaeton. Whereupon the Mexican slunk off into the stable. But as he went Pat saw
the gleam in his black eyes, and knew that some day punishment most dire and
cruel would descend upon him.</p>

<p>He passed through his second summer, that period of trial and sickness for
many infants, in perfect health. In perfect health also he passed through the
autumn and on into his second winter. Growing ever stronger with the passing
seasons, he came to reveal still further his wonderful vitality, and to reveal
it in many ways. Often he would take the initiative against the Mexican, kicking
at him without due cause, refusing always to get out of his way, once nipping
him sharply as he hurried past under pressing orders from the house. Also,
having grown to a size equal to the brown saddler, he began to reveal his
antipathy for this animal. Not only would he shoulder him away from the
feed-box, but he would kick and snap at him, and once he tipped over the
water-pail for no other reason, seemingly, than to deprive the saddler of water.
The result of all this was that, with the passing seasons, both the Mexican and
the saddler showed increasing respect for him, and the former went to every
precaution to avoid a serious encounter.</p>

<p>But it was bound to come in spite of all his efforts to avoid it. Fighting
spring flies in the stable one morning, Pat was aroused by a familiar sound in
the corral. It was the sound which usually accompanied feeding, and, whirling,
he plunged <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span> eagerly
toward the door. As he did so the Mexican, about to enter the stable, appeared
on the threshold. Pat saw him too late. He crashed headlong into the Mexican and
sent him reeling out into the inclosure. From that moment it was to the
death.</p>

<p>The Mexican painfully gained his feet and, swearing a mighty vengeance,
caught up a heavy shovel. Pat saw what was coming and, dashing out into the
corral, sought protection behind the feed-box. But the infuriated man hunted him
out, dealing upon his quivering back blow after blow, until, stung beyond all
caution, Pat sprang for the object of his suffering. But the man leaped aside,
delivering as he did so another vicious blow, this time across Pat&#8217;s
nose&#8211;most tender of places. Dazed, trembling, raging with the spirit of
battle, he surveyed the man a moment, and then, with an unnatural outcry, half
nicker, half roar, he hurtled himself upon his enemy, striking him down. But he
did not stop here. When the man attempted to rise he struck him down again, and
a third time. Then, seeing the man lying motionless, he uttered another outcry,
different from the other, a whimpering, baby outcry, and, whirling away from the
scene, hurried across the corral and into the stable, where he sought out the
family horse and, still whimpering babyishly, stood very close beside her,
seeking her sympathy and encouragement.</p>

<p>This closed the feud for all time. Miguel was not seriously hurt. But he had
learned something, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
even as Pat had learned something, and thereafter there existed tacit
understanding between them.</p>

<p>The seasons passed, and the third year came, and with it the beginning of the
end of Pat&#8217;s loneliness. One morning late in June he was aroused by the
voice of the Mexican, who, with brushes and currycomb in hand, had come to clean
him. Pat was in need of just this cleaning. Though wallowing but little, leaving
that form of exercise to the older horses, he nevertheless was gritty with sand
from swirling spring winds. So he stood very still under the hostler&#8217;s
vigorous attention. But Miguel&#8217;s ambition did not stop here. He turned to
the other horses and curried and brushed them also, working till the
perspiration streamed from him. But this was not the end. He set to work in the
stable, and scraped and cleaned to the last corner, and rubbed and scoured to
the smallest harness buckle. It was all very unusual, and Pat, standing
attentive throughout it all, revealed marked interest and something of surprise.
Soon he was to know the reason.</p>

<p>Along toward noon, as he was feeding at the box, he saw a very dignified
young woman leave the house, cross the <i>patio</i> in his direction, and come
to a stop immediately outside the fence. Though the feed-box always held his
interest above all other things, and though it was strongly attracting him now,
he nevertheless could not resist the attention with which this young woman
regarded him. He returned her gaze steadily, wondering <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span> who she was and what she meant to do. He
soon found out, for presently she set out along the fence and came to a stop
directly in front of him. She did more. She held out a hand and sounded a single
word softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pat!&#8221; she called.</p>

<p>And now something took place inside the colt. With the word, far back in his
brain, in the remotest of cells, there came an effort for freedom. It was a grim
struggle, no doubt, for the thing must fight its way against almost all other
thoughts and scenes and persons in his memory. But at length this vague memory
gained momentum and dominance. And now he understood. The young woman outside
the fence was his little mistress of early days! Lifting his head, he gave off a
shrill and protracted nicker of greeting.</p>

<p>Helen dropped her hand. &#8220;Bless you!&#8221; she cried, and sped along
the fence, opened the gate, and ran inside. &#8220;You do know me, don&#8217;t
you?&#8221; she burst out, and, hurrying to his side, hugged him convulsively.
&#8220;And I&#8217;m so glad, Pat!&#8221; she went on. &#8220;It&#8211;it has
been a long three years!&#8221; She stepped back and looked him over admiringly.
&#8220;And you have grown so! Dear, oh, dear! Three years!&#8221; Again she
stepped close and hugged him. &#8220;I am so proud of you, Pat!&#8221;</p>

<p>All this love-talk, this caressing and hugging, was as the lifting of a veil
to Pat. Within him all that had lain dormant for three years&#8211;affection,
desires, life itself&#8211;now pressed eagerly to the surface. And though his
mistress did not look <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_55'></a>55</span> the same to him&#8211;though he found himself gazing
down now instead of up to engage her eyes&#8211;yet, as if she had been gone but
a day, he suddenly nuzzled her hand for loaf sugar and quartered apples. Then as
suddenly he regretted this. For she had left him&#8211;was running across the
corral. Frantically he rushed after her and, with a shrill cry of protest, saw
her enter the house. But soon she appeared again, and when close, and he saw the
familiar sweets in her hand, he nickered again, this time in sheer delight. And
if he had doubted his good fortune before, now, with his mouth dripping luscious
juices, he knew positively that he had come into his own again.</p>

<p>Sometime during the feast Helen noticed a scar across his nose. &#8220;Why,
Pat!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;How ever did you get that?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Pat did not say. Indeed, it is doubtful whether, in this happiest of
moments, he would have descended to such commonplaces. But it was no commonplace
to Helen, and she promptly sought out the Mexican. Yet Miguel declared that he
knew nothing of the scar. He had been very watchful of the colt, he lied,
cheerfully, and the scar was as much a mystery to him as it was to her.
Whereupon Helen decided that Pat had brought it about through some prank, and,
after returning to him and indulging in further caresses and love-talk,
reluctantly took leave of him, returning to the house, there to begin unpacking
her numerous trunks.</p>

<p>Thus their friendship was renewed. Pat was <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_56'></a>56</span> older by three years, as the girl was older by three
years. But each was much older than that in point of development. Where before
had been baby affection in him and girl affection in her, now was a thing of
greater worth and more lasting quality&#8211;affection of a grown horse and a
grown woman. In the days which followed this was brought out in many ways. The
colt did not once frisk and play about the inclosure, a trait she remembered
best; yet she did not wish it. She preferred him as he was, finding in his
mature conduct something that enhanced his beauty; and rare beauty it was, as
she frequently noted in running proud eyes over his lines, and in noting it came
more and more to feel not alone great pride for him, but a sure love as
well&#8211;not the love woman gives to man, of course, but the love she can
give, and does give, without stint, to all dumb animals.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span><a id='link_6'></a>CHAPTER VI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE FIRST GREAT LESSON</span></h2>

<p>Helen spent much time in the society of the horse. Aside from attending to
his wants, such as food and water, she more than once took comb and brush in
hand and gave him a thorough cleaning. This invariably brought a grin to the
ugly features of Miguel, and when the Judge was present, which was not often, a
smile of delight mixed with derision to his ruddy features. But never would
Helen permit them to discourage her. She would brush and curry Pat till his coat
shone like new-mined coal, and then, after surveying the satiny sheen
critically, she would comb out his long tail, sometimes braid his glossy mane,
and, after that, scour his hoofs till they were as clean and fresh as the rest
of him. In her pride for him she liked to do these things, and often regretted
that he did not require her attention more than he did.</p>

<p>One day, with characteristic suddenness, she decided to have him broken to
saddle. Therefore, next morning, three horse-breakers&#8211;one professional and
two assistants&#8211;armed with ropes and saddles, appeared in the corral. Pat
was <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span> sunning himself
in his corner, and at their entrance only cocked his ears and blinked his eyes
lazily. Outside the inclosure Helen, together with a scattering of spectators,
attracted by the word of this treat in town, stood quietly expectant. One of the
assistants, a raw-boned individual with hairy wrists, drove Pat out of his
corner, while the professional, a large man of quiet demeanor, turned to Miguel,
who was standing in the stable door, and put a question to him. Miguel, out of
his own experience, warned them against the horse. Whereupon the large man
neatly roped Pat, settling the noose skilfully around the horse&#8217;s
neck.</p>

<p>Instantly Pat was a quivering bundle of nerves. Bracing his legs, he drew
back on the rope. But the man held to it grimly. The man did more. He suddenly
raced across the inclosure, gave the rope a deft twist, and followed the twist
with a vigorous jerk. Pat plunged heavily to the ground.</p>

<p>He lay dazed, breathing laboriously, till the rope slackened. Then he started
to rise. But he only gained his fore legs. The second assistant, a slender
youth, resisted his efforts, forcing Pat&#8217;s head back by sitting upon it.
Pat twisted and writhed to throw him off. But the man stayed with him, and
finally had him prone to earth again. Whereupon Pat experienced the chagrin of
his first defeat. Yet he could see. Upon the retina of each eye danced a
picture. It was that of his mistress, surrounded by open-mouthed spectators,
outside the fence, gazing down upon <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_59'></a>59</span> him with seeming approval. This once, but only this
once, he felt dislike for her.</p>

<p>One of the men approached with a halter. Pat had seen these things in the
stable, and he instinctively knew what they were for. But he would not accept
this one. Embittered by his fall, chafing under the weight upon his head, he
struggled so successfully that he finally dislodged the man. Then he sprang to
his feet again, and, trembling in every part, glared savagely at his
tormentors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better give him a twist,&#8221; quietly suggested the
professional.</p>

<p>Pat heard the remark. But he did not understand, and so remained quiet.
Presently he felt a light hand creeping up along his neck, pausing, patting him,
creeping along farther, pausing and patting him again. It was not unpleasant,
and under the soothing influence he came to believe that his tormentors had
experienced a change of attitude. But he was mistaken. Suddenly his ear was
gripped as in a vise. Also, it was twisted sharply, once, twice, and then held
in a relentless grip. He stood still as death. Up and down his spine, from his
ear to his tail, coursed shrieking pain, hacking him like the agony of a
thousand twisting knives. Under the terror of it he stopped
breathing&#8211;stopped till he must breathe or swoon. Then he did take air, in
short, faint gasps, but each gasp at terrible cost. And standing thus, fearing
to move, he accepted the halter. He could do naught else.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>The raw-boned
assistant turned to Helen apologetically. &#8220;Lively hoss, Miss
Richards,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;Reckon we&#8217;re in for a little
exercise.&#8221; And he grinned.</p>

<p>Anxiously Helen mounted the fence, standing upon a lower board. &#8220;You
won&#8217;t hurt him, I hope&#8211;that is, needlessly! I don&#8217;t want that,
you know!&#8221; And she gazed at Pat with pitiful eyes.</p>

<p>The other laughed. &#8220;No; &#8217;tain&#8217;t that,&#8221; he hastened to
reassure her. &#8220;He&#8217;s lively&#8211;that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>The professional looked Pat over speculatively, and again made a suggestion.
&#8220;Better blindfold him, Larry,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Pat heard this as he had heard the other. And because he was coming to know
this man&#8217;s voice, and to interpret it correctly, despite the agony it cost
him he went on his guard, spreading and bracing his legs as against shock. He
did not receive shock, however. Merely a piece of soft flannel was tucked gently
under his halter and drawn carefully over his eyes. Against the soft pressure of
it he closed his eyes. As he did so the hand released his ear. Conscious of
sweet relief from the dread pain now, he opened his eyes again, only to discover
that he could not see!</p>

<p>Here was new distress! He did not understand it. He knew that his eyes were
open; knew that it was the time of sunshine; knew with grim certainty that he
was awake. Yet he could not see! He flung up his head; tossed it across and
back; flung it down again. Yet the unnatural darkness! <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span> He took to pawing the ground. He began to
recall his surroundings before this strange darkness had descended upon
him&#8211;the girl outside the fence, the spectators upon the fence, the
tormentors inside the fence, the glorious sunlight, the distant shimmering
mountains, the stable and outhouses and cottage. But all were gone from him now.
Everything was black with the blackness of night! Again he tossed his
head&#8211;and again and again. But still the darkness! He was afraid.</p>

<p>Here came a change. Across his vision leaped sudden flashing lights, myriads
of them, dancing strangely before him. Gripped in new fear, he watched them
closely, saw them hurry, pause, hurry again, all in dazzling array. They kept it
up. Breathlessly he saw them dart to and fro, speed near, whirl and twist, until
out of sheer distress he closed his eyes for relief. But he got no relief. He
saw the lights as before, saw them dancing and pirouetting before his eyes, and
suddenly whisk away, as though satiated with their fiendishness. But they left
him limp and faint and with a throbbing pain in his head. Again he stamped the
earth and shook his head. But the darkness clung. He could not throw off the
thing before his eyes. Yet he persisted. He tossed his head until dizziness
seized him. Then he stopped all effort and relaxed. His head began to droop; he
let it droop, low and lower, until he smelled the earth. This aroused him. His
spirit of fight rose again. He jerked up his head, sounded a defiant outcry,
stiffened his legs for action. This <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_62'></a>62</span> for a moment only, for he did not act&#8211;somehow
felt it was not yet time. But he gave way to a grim restlessness. He took to
rocking like a chained elephant&#8211;from right hind to left fore, from left
hind to right fore legs&#8211;changing, always changing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, old son,&#8221; came a voice on his chaotic thoughts,
&#8220;we&#8217;ve just found a bridle that&#8217;ll suit. But it took us a mean
long time to do it, didn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Pat stopped swaying. He stopped suddenly, as one checked by a mighty force.
And so he was. For he knew now that the time had come. Here was his tormentor!
Here was one of them within reach! The time had come to strike, to strike this
man, to crush him to earth, to kill the cause of his suffering&#8211;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, hoss,&#8221; went on the voice, soothingly, the while Pat
smelled a something of the stable underneath his nose. &#8220;Go to it!
It&#8217;s right harmless&#8211;now, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; Which it seemed to
be from the smell.</p>

<p>But Pat struck&#8211;reared with the speed of lightning and struck.</p>

<p>The blow was unexpected. It sent the man spinning, whirling across the
inclosure. He dropped into a corner like a log.</p>

<p>There was a tense moment. Spectators sat dazed; horsemen stood rigid; the
girl screamed. Then the large man ran to the prostrate form. He bent over, gazed
briefly, straightened up with a reassuring smile. Presently the assistant <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span> arose and, rubbing his
shoulder ruefully, caught up the fallen bridle. Soon the work of breaking was
resumed as though nothing had happened.</p>

<p>Pat was standing motionless. But he was keenly alert. He heard the man draw
near, felt the hand creeping along his neck, but he had learned his lesson well.
He reared and struck again&#8211;this time only empty air. Yet, as he returned
to earth, almost before he touched ground, the hand was around his ear, another
was around his other ear, he was feeling the dread twist again, twofold. Every
twitch of muscle, every least gasp for air, sent excruciating pain throughout
the ends of him. Fearing to move, yet clamoring for breath, he slowly opened his
mouth.</p>

<p>Which was what they wanted, evidently. He felt a cold something suddenly
thrust between his teeth. It was hard as well as cold. He tasted it, rolled it
over his tongue, and found it not painful. Then came something else. His head
was being hurriedly fitted with a leathery contrivance. But neither was this
painful, save only as it touched his twisted ears, and he therefore experienced
no increasing alarm. Then, with this adjusted, he was introduced to something
else&#8211;a something held close under his nose. He smelled this carefully;
noted that it reeked with odors of the stable; smelled it again. Next he knew it
was being placed gently upon his back. It was soft, and quite hairy, and though
it irritated him a little, he accepted it without loss of composure. But when it
was followed, as it was directly, by a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_64'></a>64</span> heavier something, a something fitting his back snug
and hard, he instantly determined to rebel, despite his twisted ears. But he
could not withstand the increased pain, and he permitted the thing to be made
secure with straps around his body. And now came a heavier something, a free and
loose weight, something with spring and give to it, and which had flung up from
the ground. And suddenly, flaying his pained senses, understanding flashed upon
him. This was a man. There was a tormentor upon his back, gripping the thing in
his mouth, holding him solidly to the ground. He&#8211;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a word of command. With the word Pat felt his ears released. As he
thrilled with relief the cloth was jerked off his eyes. For a time the fierce
daylight blinded him. Then the pupils of his eyes contracted and all objects
stood out clearly again&#8211;the men in the corral, the spectators on the
fence, his mistress outside the fence. Also he saw the sunlit stable, and Miguel
in the doorway, and the house in the trees. All had come back to him, and he
stood gazing about him blinkingly, trying to understand, conscious of straps
binding his body and restraining his breathing.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he understood&#8211;remembered&#8211;remembered that he had
been abused, had been tortured as never before. And he awoke to the fact that he
was still being tortured. There was this thing in his mouth. There was this
contraption on his head. There was that thing on his <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span> back, and the weight upon the thing.
Also, there was that binding of his belly, and the irritation due to the prickly
something pressing his back and sides. All these facts stung him, and under the
whip of them he awoke to a mighty urging within. It was his fighting spirit
rekindling&#8211;the thing that was his birthright, the thing come down to him
from his ancestors, the thing that told him to rebel against the unnatural. And
heeding this, voice, heeding it because he knew no other, he decided to give
decisive battle.</p>

<p>In a frenzy of effort he suddenly reared. He pirouetted on hind legs; pawed
the air with fore legs; lost his balance. Failing to recover himself, he went
over backward. He struck the earth resoundingly, but he realized that the weight
was gone, and he felt a faint glow of victory!</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow!&#8221; yelled a spectator, excitedly.</p>

<p>Pat heard this and hastily regained his feet. And because he was uncertain of
his next move he remained motionless. This was a mistake, as he soon discovered.
For he saw two men leap, grasp both his ears; felt the dread twist again. So he
remained still, and he felt the man mount again. Then came rumbling in upon his
tortured soul again the insistent voice telling him to rebel further, and to
keep on rebelling until through sheer brute strength he had mastered these
unnatural things. With the grip on his ears released he once more gave heed to
this clamoring within.</p>

<p>He leaped straight up into the air. Returning to earth with nerve-shattering
shock, he whirled <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
suddenly, pitched and bucked, tossed and twisted, all in mad effort. But the
weight clung fast. He whirled again, and again leaped, leaped clear of the
ground, returning to it this time on stiffened legs. But he could not shake off
the weight. He flung across the corral, twisting, writhing, bucking; flung back
again&#8211;heart thumping, lungs shrieking for air, muscles wrenching and
straining; and again across, responding, and continuing to respond, to the
ringing voice within, like the king of kings that he was. But he could not
dislodge the weight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great!&#8221; yelled an excited spectator.</p>

<p>&#8220;See that hoss sunfishin&#8217;!&#8221; burst out another.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; corkscrewin&#8217;!&#8221; added a third.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better &#8217;n a outlaw!&#8221; amplified a fourth.</p>

<p>And now the first again: &#8220;Stay with him, Alex! I got two
dollars&#8211;Oh, hell!&#8221;&#8211;this disgustedly. &#8220;Come out o&#8217;
that corner!&#8221; Then suddenly he turned, face red as fire, and apologized to
Helen. &#8220;I beg your pardon, Miss Richards,&#8221; he offered, meekly. But
he turned back to the spectacle and promptly forgot all else in his returning
excitement. &#8220;Shoot it to him, Alex!&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;Shoot it;
shoot it! He&#8217;s a helldinger, that hoss!&#8221; Frenziedly he then yawped,
cowboy fashion: &#8220;Whe-e-e-o-o-o-yip-yip! Whe-e-e-o-o-o-yip-yip!&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet Helen&#8211;poor Helen!&#8211;had not heard. Holding her breath in tense
fear, eyes upon her pride fighting his fight of pride, half hopeful that <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span> he would win, yet fearful
of that very thing, she watched the strife of man skill against brute strength,
keyed up almost to snapping-point.</p>

<p>But her horse did not win. Neither did he lose. She saw him take up, one
after another, every trick known to those familiar with horses, and she marveled
greatly at his unexpected knowledge of things vicious. Along one side of the
inclosure, across the side adjacent to it, back along the side opposite to the
second, then forward along the first again&#8211;thus round the corral&#8211;he
writhed and twisted in mighty effort, bucking and pitching and whirling and
flinging, the while the sun rose higher in the morning sky. Spectators clambered
down from the fence, stood awhile to relieve cramped muscles, clambered on the
fence again; but the horse fought on; coat necked with white slaver, glistening
with streaming sweat in the sunlight, eyes wild, mouth grim, ears back, he
fought on and on till it seemed that he must stop through sheer exhaustion. But
still he fought, valiantly, holding to the battle until, with a raging,
side-pitching twist, one never before seen, he lost his footing, plunged to the
ground, tore up twenty feet of earth, crashed headlong into the fence, ripped
out three boards clean as though struck by lightning&#8211;lay motionless in a
crumpled heap.</p>

<p>The man was thrown. He arose hastily. As he wiped away his perspiration and
grime he saw blood on his handkerchief. He was bruised and <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span> bleeding, and wrenched inwardly, yet when
Pat, returning to consciousness, hastily gained his feet, the man leaped for the
horse, sounding a muffled curse. But he did not mount. And for good reason. For
Pat was reeling like a drunken man&#8211;head drooping, fore parts swaying, eyes
slowly closing. At the sight one of the spectators made a plea in Pat&#8217;s
behalf.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whyn&#8217;t you take him outside?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;Into the
open. This ain&#8217;t no place to bust a horse like him! That horse needs air!
Get him out into about three-quarters of these United States! Git ginerous! Git
ginerous! I hate a stingy man!&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereupon Helen at last found voice. &#8220;Wait!&#8221; she cried, evenly,
and, turning, sped along the fence to the gate. Inside the corral she hurried to
the horse and flung her arms around his neck. &#8220;Pat dear,&#8221; she began,
tenderly, &#8220;I am so sorry! But it&#8217;s &#8217;most over with now, if
you&#8217;ll only accept it! Can&#8217;t you see, Pat? It is so very necessary
to both of us! For then I myself can ride you! Please, Pat&#8211;please, for my
sake!&#8221; Whereupon Pat, as if all else were forgotten&#8211;all the torture,
all the struggle and shock&#8211;nickered softly and nuzzled her hands for sugar
and apples. Suppressing a smile, and accepting this as a good omen, she stroked
him a few times more and then stepped back. &#8220;Later, dear!&#8221; she
promised and left him, suddenly mindful of spectators. But, though she felt the
blood rush into her cheeks, she did not leave the inclosure. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span> The horse-breaker stepped
resolutely to Pat and, laying firm hands upon the bridle, waited a moment, eying
Pat narrowly, then flung up into the saddle. Pat&#8217;s sides heaved, his knees
trembled, but he did not resist. Eyes trained upon his mistress, as if he would
hold her to her promise, he set out peacefully, and of his own volition, across
the inclosure. Further, even though he could not see his mistress now, he turned
in response to the rein and started back across the inclosure. And he kept this
up, holding to perfect calm, breaking into a trot when urged to it, falling back
into a walk in response to the bridle, round and round and round until, with a
grunt of satisfaction, the man dismounted close beside the girl and handed her
the reins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rides easy as a single-footer, Miss Richards,&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;Where can I wash up?&#8221;</p>

<p>Which ended Pat&#8217;s first great lesson at the hands of man. But though
this lesson had its values, since he was destined to serve mankind, yet he had
learned another thing that held more value to him as an animal than all the
teachings within the grasp of men&#8211;he had learned the inevitable workings
of cause and effect. His nose was scraped and his knees were scraped, and all
these places burned intensely. And, intelligent horse that he was, he knew why
he suffered these burns&#8211;knew that he had brought them about through his
own sheer wilfulness. True, he was still girt with bands and straps, and in a
way they were uncomfortable. But they did not pain him <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span> as the wounds pained him. Not that he
reasoned all this out. He was but a dumb animal, and pure reasoning was
blissfully apart from him. But he did know the difference between what had been
desired of him and what he himself had brought on through sheer wilfulness. Thus
he awakened, having learned this lesson with his headlong plunge into the fence,
and having added to the lesson of the futility of rebellion the very clear
desires of his mistress. Other and less intelligent horses would have continued
to respond to the ancestral voice within till death. But Pat was more than such
a horse.</p>

<p>With the men gone, he revealed his intelligence further. Helen commissioned
Miguel to fit him with her saddle and bridle, then hurried herself off to the
house. Returning, clad in riding-habit and with hands full of sugar and
quartered apples, she fed these delectables to him till his mouth dripped
delightful juices. Then, while yet he munched the sweets, she mounted
fearlessly. Sitting perfectly still for a time to accustom him to her weight,
she then gave him the rein and word. Without hesitation he responded, stepping
out across the inclosure, acknowledging her guiding rein in the corner,
returning to the starting-place and, with the word, coming to a stop. It was all
very beautiful, rightly understood, and, thrilled with her success, Helen sat
still again, sat for a long time, gazing soberly down upon him. Then she bent
forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pat,&#8221; she began, her voice breaking a little <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span> with emotion suddenly
overwhelming her, &#8220;this begins our real friendship and understanding. Let
us try to make it equal&#8221;&#8211;she straightened up, narrow eyes off toward
the mountains&#8211;&#8220;equal to the best that lies within us
both.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span><a id='link_7'></a>CHAPTER VII<br /><span class='h2fs'>A STRANGER</span></h2>

<p>As the weeks passed, each day bringing its period of companionship, this
friendship and understanding between them became perfect in its simplicity. Pat
learned to know her wishes almost without the reins, and he showed that he loved
to carry her. Also, with these daily canters on the mesa he developed in bodily
strength, and it was not long before he was in the pink of condition. Yet it was
a perfection that was only natural for him. The quality of his blood was shown
in his nostrils, which were wide and continuously atremble; in his eyes, which
were bright and keenly alert; and in his ears, which were fine and vibrant.
Stepping through town each morning under Helen&#8217;s restraining hand, he
would pick up his hoofs with a cleanliness and place them down with a grace that
always commanded the attention of admiring eyes. But he seemed unconscious of
his quality.</p>

<p>Dressed in her usual dark riding-habit, Helen entered the corral one morning
for her daily canter across the mesa. Already Pat was bridled and saddled. But
as she stepped alongside to <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_73'></a>73</span> mount, Miguel appeared in the stable door with a
brief tale of trouble and a warning. It seemed that he had experienced
difficulty in preparing the horse, and between puffs at a cigarette he strongly
advised Helen to be careful.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a-very fresh thees mornin&#8217;,&#8221; he concluded, with
an ominous shake of his head.</p>

<p>Helen looked Pat over. He appeared in anything but a cantankerous mood. He
was standing quietly, eyes blinking sleepily, ears wriggling lazily, in an
attitude of superior indifference toward all the world. So, untroubled by the
hostler&#8217;s tale, she slipped her foot into the stirrup. Instantly the horse
nickered queerly and stepped away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Steady, Pat!&#8221; she gently admonished, and again attempted to
mount. But, as before, he stepped away, this time more abruptly. He began to
circle around her, prancing nervously, pausing to paw the ground, prancing again
nervously. She held firm grip on his bridle, however, and sharply rebuked him.
&#8220;Pat,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;this is a new trait!&#8221; And then,
before he could resist again, she caught hold of the saddle-horn, leaped up,
hardly touching the stirrup, and gathered the reins quickly to meet further
rebellion.</p>

<p>But with her in the saddle Pat was quite another horse. He snapped his ears
at attention, wheeled to the gate, and cantered briskly out of the corral.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful morning. The air nipped with a tang of frost, and she rode
swiftly through town and up the hill to the mesa in keen exhilaration. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span> Once on the mesa, Pat
dashed off ecstatically in the direction of the mountains. The pace was
thrilling. The rush of the crisp wind, together with the joy of swift motion,
sent tingling blood into Helen&#8217;s cheeks, while the horse, racing along at
top speed, flung out his hoofs with a vigor that told of the riot of blood
within him. Thus they continued, until in the shadow of the mountains&#8211;just
now draped in their most delicate coloring, the pink that accompanies sunbeams
streaming through fading haze&#8211;she pulled Pat down and gave herself over to
the beauty of the scene. The horse, also appreciative, came to a ready stop and
turned his eyes out over the desert in slow-blinking earnestness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pat!&#8221; suddenly cried Helen. She pulled his head gently around in
the direction of the mountain trail. &#8220;Look off there!&#8221;</p>

<p>Above the distant trail hung a thin cloud of dust, and under the cloud of
dust, and rolling heavily toward town, creaked a lumber rigging, piled high with
wood and drawn by a pair of plodding horses&#8211;plodding despite the bite and
snarl of a whip swung with merciless regularity. The whip was in the hands of a
brawny Mexican, who, seated confidently on the high load, appeared utterly
indifferent to the trembling endeavors of his scrawny team. He was inhaling the
smoke of a cigarette, and with every puff mechanically flaying the horses. The
spectacle aroused deep sympathy in the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only consider, Pat!&#8221; she exclaimed, after a <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span> while. &#8220;Those poor, miserable
horses&#8211;half-starved, cruelly beaten, yet of God&#8217;s own making!&#8221;
She was silent. &#8220;Suppose you had been born to that service, Pat&#8211;born
to that oppression! You are one of the fortunate!&#8221; And she bent forward
and stroked him. &#8220;One of the fortunate!&#8221; she repeated,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Indeed Pat was just that. But not in the way Helen meant. For such was the
whim of Fate, and such is the limit of human understanding, she did not know,
and never would know, save by the grace of that Fate, that Pat had been born in
just that service, born to just that oppression; that only by the kindness of
Fate he had been released from that service, that oppression, that he had been
guided out of that environment and cast into a more kindly, bigger, and truer
environment&#8211;her own!</p>

<p>But Pat only blinked stolid indifference at the spectacle. He appeared to
care nothing for the misery of other horses, nor to appreciate her tenderness
when directed elsewhere than toward himself. After a time, as if to reveal this,
he set out of his own volition toward a particularly inviting bit of flower,
dainty yellow in the brown of the desert. Plucking this morsel, he fell to
munching it in contentment, and continued to munch it till the last vestige
disappeared. Then, again of his own volition, he broke into a canter. Helen
smiled and pulled him down.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a strange horse, Pat,&#8221; she declared, and fell to
stroking him again. &#8220;And not the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_76'></a>76</span> least strange thing about you is your history.
Sometimes I wonder whether you are actually blooded. Certainly you look it, and
at times assuredly you act it; yet if you are so valuable, why didn&#8217;t
somebody claim you that time? It is all very mysterious.&#8221; And she relapsed
into silence, gazing at him thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Aroused by sudden faint gusts of wind, she glanced around and overhead. She
saw unmistakable signs of an approaching storm, and swung Pat about toward home.
As the horse broke into a canter the gusts became more fitful and sharper, while
the sun, growing dim and hazy, cast ever-increasing shadow before her.
Presently, as far as the eye could reach, she saw the landscape spring into
active life. Dust-devils whirled about in quick eddies, stray sheets of paper
leaped up, tumbleweed began steady forward movement, rabbit-like, scurrying
before the winds, the advance occupied by largest growths, the rear brought up
with smallest clumps, the order determined by the area each presented to the
winds. It was all very impressive, but, knowing the uncertain character of the
elements, and uncertain whether this foretold violent sand-storm or milder
wind-storm, she was gripped with apprehension. She urged Pat to his utmost.</p>

<p>And Pat responded, though he really needed but little urging. With each
sudden gust he became increasingly afraid. Holding himself more and more alert
to every least movement about him, he was steadily becoming keyed up to a
dangerous <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span> pitch.
Rollicking tumbleweed did not worry him any more than did the swirling
dust-devils. These were things of the desert, each the complexion of the desert.
But not so with scraps of paper. Their whiteness offered a startling contrast to
the others, and, whisking about frantically, they increased his fears. Then
suddenly a paper struck him, whipped madly across his eyes. It was unexpected,
and for an instant blinded him. Gripping the bit in his teeth, he bolted.</p>

<p>His sudden plunge almost unseated Helen. But, recovering, she braced herself
grimly in the stirrups and pulled mightily on the reins. But she could not hold
him. He increased his speed, if anything, and hurtled across the
desert&#8211;head level, ears flat, legs far-reaching. She braced herself again,
flinging back head and shoulders, thrusting her feet far forward, and continued
to pull. But it counted for nothing. Yet she did not weaken, and under her
vigorous striving, coupled with the jolting of the horse, her
tam-o&#8217;-shanter flew off, and her hair loosened and fell, streaming out
whippingly behind. And then suddenly, struck with terror herself, she cried out
in terror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pat!&#8221; she burst out. &#8220;Pat! Pat!&#8221;</p>

<p>But the horse seemed not to hear. Thundering madly forward, he appeared blind
as well as fear-stricken, and Helen, suddenly seeing a barb-wire fence ahead,
felt herself go faint, for she had never taken a fence, and she knew that Pat
never had. She must get control of herself again. And this <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span> she did. Stiffening in the stirrups, she
gripped a single rein in both hands and pulled with all her strength. But she
could not swerve the horse. On he plunged for the obstruction, evidently not
seeing it. She screamed again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pat! Pat! Pat!&#8221;</p>

<p>But, as before, the horse did not heed. He dashed to the fence. He hesitated,
but only for an instant. Throwing up his head, he rose and took the fence
cleanly. Once on the other side, he resumed his frantic racing&#8211;pounding
along in the mountain trail, his course clearly defined, hurtling madly straight
toward town. With the fence safely cleared, and the way ahead free of vehicles,
Helen regained much of her composure. Settling calmly to the rhythmic movement,
she permitted the horse free rein. Once she reached back to gather up her hair,
but the motion of the horse forbade this. So she fell to watching his splendid
energy, finding herself quite calm and collected again, vaguely wondering how it
would end. For the horse seemed tireless.</p>

<p>Wise in his knowledge of first principles, and remembering the terrible slap
across his eyes, Pat continued to rush forward. As he ran he kept eyes alert
about him, fearing another blow. He knew that the thing was white, and he
watched for a white something. Instead of a white something, however, there
presently loomed up beside him a brown something, browner even than the desert,
a something racing along beside him, moving with a speed equal to his
own&#8211;even greater <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_79'></a>79</span> than his own! But he did not pause to analyze this.
Instead, he forced himself to greater efforts, pounding the hardened trail with
an energy that hurt his ankles, stretching neck and legs to their utmost limit
of fiber&#8211;on and on in increased frenzy. But he could not best this object
beside him. Yet that did not discourage him. He continued grimly forward, stung
to desperation now by a double purpose, which was to outrun this thing on his
right as well as get away from the other possible pursuing object. Yet the brown
thing gained upon him&#8211;drew steadily nearer, steadily closer&#8211;he saw a
hand shoot out. He felt a strong pull on his bridle, a tearing twist on the bit
in his mouth, and found himself thrown out of his stride. But not even with this
would he accept defeat. He reared in a nervous effort to shake off the hand.
Finding this futile, he dropped back again, and at last came to a trembling,
panting, nerve-racked pause.</p>

<p>The thing was a horseman. He hurriedly dismounted, still retaining hold on
Pat&#8217;s bridle, and smiled up at Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I tried to overtake you&#8211;to overtake you before you
reached the fence,&#8221; he began to explain, pausing between words for breath.
&#8220;This horse of yours can&#8211;can claim&#8211;claim anything on
record&#8211;for speed.&#8221; And he looked Pat over admiringly.</p>

<p>Helen did not speak at once. In the moment needed to regain her
self-possession she could only regard him with mute gratitude. She saw that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span> he was young and
well-built, though lean of features, but with frank, healthy eyes. He was not at
all bad-looking. Also she observed that he was neatly garbed in puttees and
knickerbockers, and she quickly appraised him as the usual type of Easterner
come into the valley to spend the winter. Then she suddenly remembered her hair.
Woman-like, she hastily gathered it up into a knot at the back of her head
before she answered this young man smiling up at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pat never ran like that before,&#8221; she explained, a bit nervously.
&#8220;I was beginning to wonder what would happen at the railroad crossing. You
checked him just in time. I&#8211;I really owe&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure he won&#8217;t charge again?&#8221; interrupted the young man,
evidently wishing to avoid any expression of gratitude on her part.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I am quite certain,&#8221; she replied, and then, after
thanking him, slowly gathered up the reins. But she did not ride on, for the
reason that the other, now absorbed in a cool survey of Pat&#8217;s outlines,
retained his hold on the bridle. Yet neither the survey nor the grip on the
bridle displeased her.</p>

<p>&#8220;A splendid horse,&#8221; he declared, after a moment. &#8220;A
beautiful animal!&#8221; Then, evidently suddenly mindful that he was detaining
her, he stepped back.</p>

<p>Helen again prepared to ride on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pat is a beautiful horse,&#8221; she agreed, still a little nervous.
&#8220;And like all beauty,&#8221; she added, &#8220;he develops strange moods
at times.&#8221; Then, her <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_81'></a>81</span> sense of deep gratitude moving her, she asked,
&#8220;Were you going toward town?&#8221;</p>

<p>For reply he swung into the saddle. He wheeled close, and they set out. He
appeared a little ill at ease, and Helen took the initiative.</p>

<p>&#8220;From the East, I take it?&#8221; she inquired. &#8220;There are not a
few Easterners down here. Some have taken up permanent residence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;I&#8217;m from the East&#8211;New
York.&#8221;</p>

<p>She liked his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are here for the winter&#8211;mother and myself. Mother isn&#8217;t
strong, and your delightful climate ought to improve her. I myself came
along&#8221;&#8211;he turned twinkling eyes toward her&#8211;&#8220;as guide and
comforter and&#8211;I fear&#8211;all-round nuisance.&#8221; He was silent.
&#8220;I like this country,&#8221; he added, after a moment.</p>

<p>Helen liked him for liking her country, for she had true Western pride for
her birthplace. So she said the natural thing, though without display of pride.
&#8220;Everybody likes it down here.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her hesitatingly. &#8220;You&#8217;re not from the outside,
then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she rejoined. &#8220;I am a native.&#8221;</p>

<p>He showed restless curiosity now. &#8220;Tell me,&#8221; he began,
engagingly, &#8220;about this country. What, for instance, must one do, must one
be, to&#8211;to be&#8211;well, to be accepted as a native!&#8221; He said this
much as one feeling his way among a people new to him, as if, conscious of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span> informal nature of
their meeting, he would ease that informality, yet did not know precisely
how.</p>

<p>Yet Helen found herself quite comfortable in his society now, and, permitting
herself great freedom, she spoke almost with levity.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have asked me a difficult question,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Offhand I should say you must ride every morning, sleep some part of the
early afternoon, and&#8211;oh, well, ride the next morning again, I
reckon.&#8221; And she smiled across at him. &#8220;Are you thinking of staying
with us?&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded soberly. Then he went on. &#8220;What else must one do?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;Is that all?&#8221; His eyes were still twinkling.</p>

<p>Helen herself was sober now. &#8220;No,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;not quite.
One must think a little, work a little, do a little good. We are very close
together down here&#8211;very close to one another&#8211;and very, very far from
the rest of the world. So we try to make each day register something of value,
not alone for ourselves, but for our neighbors as well.&#8221; She was silent.
&#8220;We are a distinct race of people,&#8221; she concluded, after a
moment.</p>

<p>He turned his head. &#8220;I like all that,&#8221; he declared, simply.
&#8220;Though I&#8217;m afraid I won&#8217;t do&#8211;much as I dislike to admit
it. You see, I&#8217;ve never learned to live much in the interest of
others.&#8221; He regarded her with steady eyes.</p>

<p>Helen liked him for that, too. Evidently he had had too much breeding, and,
from his remark, knew it. So she took it upon herself at least to offer him
encouragement.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>&#8220;You will
learn,&#8221; she rejoined, smiling. &#8220;Everybody does.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this, Helen discreetly changed the subject. She entered upon less
intimate matters, and soon, sweeping off into a rhapsody over the
country&#8211;its attraction for Easterners, its grip on Westerners&#8211;she
was chatting with a freedom typical of the country. For by now she was
interested, and for some inexplicable reason she found herself drawn to the
smiling stranger.</p>

<p>Also, Pat was interested. But not in the things which appealed to his
mistress. Pat was pondering the sullen nature of the horse beside him, and as
they rode slowly toward town he stole frequent sidelong glances at his
unfriendly companion. But all he could arrive at was that, while appearing
peaceable enough, this horse was the most self-satisfied animal chance had ever
thrown his way. After a time he ceased all friendly advances, such as pressing
close beside him and now and again playfully nipping at him, and took up his own
affairs, finding deep cause for satisfaction in the return of his breath after
the long race, and in the passing of pain from his strained legs, to say nothing
of the complete absence of flying papers around him.</p>

<p>They crossed the railroad track and entered the town. Here the young man took
a polite leave of Helen, and Pat, seeing the unfriendly horse canter away at a
brisk gait, himself set out briskly, feeling somehow called upon to emulate the
step of the other. And thus he continued through town to the <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span> river trail, which he
followed at an even brisker stride, and thence to the ranch and the corral. Here
his mistress took leave of him&#8211;abruptly, it seemed&#8211;and made her way
straight into the house. Directly the Mexican came and removed his saddle and
bridle. With these things off, he shook himself vigorously, and then took up his
customary stand in the corner, and confidently awaited the reappearance of his
mistress with sugar and apples&#8211;a reward she never had denied him.</p>

<p>But he waited this time in vain.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span><a id='link_8'></a>CHAPTER VIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>FELIPE MAKES A DISCOVERY</span></h2>

<p>Pat waited in vain two whole days. Not once did she come to him, not once did
he lay eyes upon her. He became nervous and irritable, and in this emptiness,
equal to that which he had suffered during the three years she was away, he
spent every waking moment in the corral, standing in his favorite corner, eyes
strained toward the house, occasionally interrupting the silence with a pleading
nicker. But his vigil gained him nothing, his watching remained unrewarded, his
outcries went unanswered. Finally, with the close of each day he would enter the
stable, but only to brood through half the night&#8211;wondering, wondering. But
never did he give up hope. Nor had he given up hope now, this morning of the
third day, when, standing in his corner as usual, he heard a door close in the
house.</p>

<p>As always, his heart leaped with expectation, and he gave off a protracted
whinny. Also he pressed close to the fence. This time he was not disappointed.
For coming slowly toward him, with her hands behind her back, was his
mistress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pat,&#8221; she began, standing close before him, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span> &#8220;I have neglected you purposely.
And I did it because I have lost confidence in you.&#8221; She regarded him a
long moment coldly, then was forced to smile. &#8220;I suppose I feel toward you
much as I used to feel toward a doll of mine that had fallen and cracked its
head. I want to shake you, yet I can&#8217;t help but feel sorry for you,
too.&#8221; And again she was silent.</p>

<p>Pat shifted his feet uneasily. He did not quite understand all this, though
he knew, despite the smile of his mistress, that it was serious. Still,
encouraged by the smile, he pressed close and asked for sweets, nuzzling her
coat-sweater persistently. But she stepped away. Whereupon he reached his neck
after her, and became almost savage in his coaxing. Finally he was relieved to
see her burst into a peal of laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here!&#8221; she said, and held out both hands. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
care if your head is broken!&#8221;</p>

<p>Glory be! Two red apples in one hand; a whole handful of loaf sugar in the
other! If ever a horse smiled, he smiled then. Also, he promptly accepted some
of the sugar, and, enjoying every delicious mouthful, reached for an apple. But
she drew back. Evidently she was not yet finished with her reprimand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blissfully unconscious of your behavior that morning, aren&#8217;t
you?&#8221; she continued. &#8220;Not a bit ashamed; not one speck
regretful!&#8221;</p>

<p>Well&#8211;he wasn&#8217;t. He was not a bit ashamed, not one speck
regretful. Merely, he was sweet-hungry. And now that the sugar was gone, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span> wanted one of those
apples mightily. Finally she gave him one, and then the other, feeding them to
him rapidly, but not more rapidly than he wanted them. Then she spoke again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pat dear,&#8221; she said, her voice undergoing change,
&#8220;I&#8217;m troubled. I am foolish, I know. But I can&#8217;t help it. I
advised that very nice young man to ride every morning. And he may do it. But if
he does, sooner or later, perhaps the very first morning, we shall meet up there
on the mesa. I want that, of course; but for reasons best known to Easterners, I
don&#8217;t want it&#8211;not yet.&#8221; She gazed off toward the mountains.
&#8220;I reckon, Pat dear,&#8221; she concluded, after a moment, turning her
eyes back to him, &#8220;we&#8217;d better ride in the afternoons for a time.
Yet the afternoons are so uncomfortably hot. Oh, dear! What shall I
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>But the horse did not answer her. All he did was stand very still, eyes
blinking slowly, seemingly aware of the gravity of the situation, yet unable to
help her. Indeed, that her serious demeanor had struck a note of sympathy within
him he presently revealed by once more pressing very close to her&#8211;this in
the face of the fact that she had no more sweets with her and he could see that
she had no more. The movement forced her back, and evidently he perceived his
mistake, for he quickly retraced one step. Then he fell to regarding her with
curious intentness, his head twisting slowly in a vertical plane, much as a dog
regards his master, until, evidently finding this plane of vision becoming
awkward, he stopped. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
After which Helen playfully seized his ears and shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a perfect dear!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;And I love
you! But I&#8217;m afraid we&#8211;we can&#8217;t ride mornings any
more&#8211;not for a while, at any rate.&#8221; With this she left him.</p>

<p>He followed her to the gate, and with reluctance saw her enter the house.
Then he rested his head upon the topmost board and, though he hardly expected
it, waited for her return. Finally he abandoned his vigil, making his way slowly
into the stable. He found both horses in their stalls, restlessly whisking their
tails, offering nothing of friendliness or invitation. Also he awoke to the
depressing atmosphere here, and after a time returned to the corral, where he
took up a stand in his favorite corner and closed his eyes. Soon he was
dreaming.</p>

<p>Sound as from a great distance awoke him. He opened his eyes. Outside the
fence, and regarding him gloatingly, were two swarthy Mexicans in conversation.
This was what had awakened him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bet you&#8217; life!&#8221; one was saying, the taller man of the two.
&#8220;Thot&#8217;s my li&#8217;l&#8217; horse grown big lak a house&#8211;and a-fine!
Franke, we gettin&#8217; thot <i>caballo</i> quick. We&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>A door had closed somewhere. The men heard it and crouched. But neither
abandoned the ground. After some little time, hearing nothing further to alarm
them, they set out along the fence to a rear door in the stable. It was not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span> locked, and they
lifted the latch and tiptoed inside. Up past the stalls they crept with cat-like
stealth, gained the door leading into the corral, came to a pause, and gazed
outside. The horse was still in his corner, his black coat glistening in the
sunlight, and Felipe once more burst into comment, excited, but carefully
subdued.</p>

<p>&#8220;A-fine! A-fine!&#8221; he breathed, rapturously. &#8220;He&#8217;s
lookin&#8217; joost lak a circus horse! You know, Franke,&#8221; he added,
turning to the other, &#8220;I haf see thee pictures on thee
fences&#8211;&#8221; He interrupted himself, for the man had disappeared.
&#8220;Franke!&#8221; he called, whispering. &#8220;You coom here. You all thee
time&#8211;&#8221; He checked himself and smiled at the other&#8217;s
forethought. For Franke was emerging from a stall, carrying a halter.
&#8220;Good!&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;I am forgettin&#8217; thot,
<i>compadre</i>!&#8221; Then once more he turned admiring eyes upon the horse.
&#8220;Never&#8211;<i>never</i>&#8211;haf I see a horse lak thot! Mooch good
luck is comin&#8217; now, Franke! Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>They stepped bravely forth into the corral. Yet their hour had been well
timed. The house was still, quiet in its morning affairs, while the countryside
around, wrapped in pulsating quiet, gave off not a sound. Cautiously approaching
the horse, Franke slipped the halter into position, the while Felipe once more
uttered his admiration. He was a little more direct and personal, however, this
time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you black devil!&#8221; he began, doubling his fist under
Pat&#8217;s nose. &#8220;You haf run away <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_90'></a>90</span> from me thot time, eh? But you don&#8217; run away
again&#8211;bet you&#8217; life! I got you now and I keep you thees time! I haf
work for you&#8211;you black devil&#8211;mooch work! You coom along
now!&#8221;</p>

<p>They led the horse into the stable, down past the stalls, and out the back
door. Then they set out toward the river trail, and, with many furtive glances
toward the house, gained it without interruption. Felipe&#8217;s lumber rigging
and team of scrawny horses stood in the shade of a cottonwood, and Franke made
the horse fast to the outhanging end of the reach. When he was secure both men
seated themselves just back of the forward bolster, one behind the other, and
Felipe sent his horses forward. Safely out of the danger zone, though Felipe
entertained but little fear of the consequences of this act, believing that he
could easily prove his ownership, he became more elated with his success and
burst out into garrulous speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, Franke,&#8221; he began, with a backward glance at the horse
ambling along peacefully in the dust, &#8220;thot <i>caballo</i> he&#8217;s
strong lak a ox. He&#8217;s makin&#8217; a fine horse&#8211;a <i>fine</i>
horse&#8211;in thees wagon! He&#8217;s&#8211;&#8221; He suddenly interrupted
himself. &#8220;Franke,&#8221; he offered, generously, &#8220;for thees help
I&#8217;m takin&#8217; off five dolars on thot debt now. You know? You haf never
pay me thot bet&#8211;thee big bet&#8211;thee one on thee wagon and thee horses.
And you haf steal seex dolars, too! But I&#8217;m forgettin&#8217; thot, now,
too. All right?&#8221;</p>

<p>The other nodded grateful acceptance. Then, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_91'></a>91</span> as if to show gratitude further, he very solicitously
inquired into the matter, especially with reference to Felipe&#8217;s discovery
of the horse after all these years. They were clattering across the mesa now,
having come to it by way of a long detour round the town, and before replying
Felipe gave his team loose rein.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he began, as the horses fell back into a plodding walk,
&#8220;I haf know about thot couple weeks before. I haf see thees <i>caballo</i>
in town one mornin&#8217;, and a girl she is ridin&#8217; heem, and everybody is
lookin&#8217;, and so I&#8217;m lookin&#8217;.&#8221; He paused to roll a
cigarette. &#8220;And then,&#8221; he continued, drawing a deep inhale of smoke,
&#8220;I haf know quick lak thot&#8221;&#8211;he snapped his fingers
sharply&#8211;&#8220;quick lak thot&#8221;&#8211;he snapped his fingers
again&#8211;&#8220;there&#8217;s my <i>potrillo</i> grown big lak a house! And
so&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how you knowin&#8217; thot&#8217;s thee horse?&#8221; interrupted
the other. &#8220;How you knowin&#8217; thot for sure?&#8221; Evidently Franke
was beginning to entertain grave doubts concerning this visit to the corral.</p>

<p>But Felipe only sneered. &#8220;How I know thot?&#8221; he asked,
disdainfully. &#8220;I&#8217;m joost tellin&#8217; you! I know! Thot&#8217;s
enough! A horse is a horse! And I know thees horse! I know every horse! I got
only to see a horse once&#8211;once only&#8211;and I&#8217;m never
forgettin&#8217; thot horse! And I&#8217;m makin&#8217; no meestake
now&#8211;bet you&#8217; life!&#8221; Nevertheless, flicked with doubt because
of the gravity of the other, he turned his head and gazed back at the <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span> horse long and earnestly.
Finally he turned around again. &#8220;I know thot horse!&#8221; he yelled.
&#8220;And I&#8217;m tellin&#8217; you thees, Franke,&#8221; he went on,
suddenly belligerent toward the other. &#8220;If you don&#8217; t&#8217;ink I&#8217;m
gettin&#8217; thee right <i>caballo</i>, I have you arrested for stealin&#8217;
thot seex dolars thot time! Money is money, too. But a horse is a horse. I know
thees horse. Thot&#8217;s enough!&#8221; Yet he relapsed into a moody silence,
puffing thoughtfully on his cigarette.</p>

<p>Behind the outfit, Pat continued along docilely. In a way he was enjoying
this strange journey across the mesa. It was all very new to him, this manner of
crossing, this being tied to the rear of a wagon, and he found himself
pleasantly mystified. Nor was that all. Not once had he felt called upon to
rebel. In perfect contentment he followed the rigging, eyes upon the outhanging
reach, for he was intent upon maintaining safe distance between this thing and
himself. Once, when they were mounting up to the mesa, he had met with a sharp
blow from this projection&#8211;due to sudden change of gait in the
horses&#8211;and he only required the one lesson to be ever after careful. As
for the men forward, he knew nothing of them, and never, to his knowledge, had
seen them before. But in no way was he concerning himself about them. Nor,
indeed, was he worrying over any part of this proceeding. For in his dumb animal
way he was coming to know, as all dumb servants of man come to know, that life,
after all, is service, a kind of self-effacing series <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span> of tasks in the interests of others, and
that this ambling along behind the vehicle was but one of the many kinds.</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; suddenly broke out Felipe, who, having threshed the matter
out to his satisfaction, now felt sure of his position once more, &#8220;I haf
follow thees girl and thee horse. I haf see thee place where she&#8217;s
goin&#8217;&#8211;you know.&#8221; And he winked foxily. &#8220;And then I haf
coom to thees place, two, three times after thee horse. But always thee man is
there. But thees mornin&#8217; I&#8217;m seein&#8217; thot <i>hombre</i> in
town, and so I haf go gettin&#8217; you to coom help me. But you haf steal seex
dolars. I&#8217;m forgettin&#8217; thot&#8211;not! And if you say soomt&#8217;ing to
soombody soomtime, I&#8217;m havin&#8217; you arrested, Franke, for a t&#8217;ief and
a robber&#8211;same as I ought to arrest thot Pedro Garcia oop in the
canyon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Franke maintained discreet silence. But not for long. Evidently he suddenly
thought of a point in his own favor.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217; havin&#8217; good luck thees time, Felipe,&#8221; he
declared, tranquilly, &#8220;especially,&#8221; he hastened to add, &#8220;when
I&#8217;m t&#8217;inkin&#8217; of thee halter. Without thee halter, you know, you
don&#8217; gettin&#8217; thees <i>caballo</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Felipe ignored this. &#8220;I haf need a horse,&#8221; he went on,
thoughtfully. &#8220;Thee mot&#8217;er of thees black fel&#8217;r&#8211;you know,
thot&#8217;s thee mot&#8217;er&#8211;she&#8217;s gettin&#8217; old all time.
She&#8217;s soon dyin&#8217;, thot <i>caballo</i>. Thees black horse he&#8217;s
makin&#8217; a fine one in thees wagon.&#8221; <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_94'></a>94</span> Franke said nothing. Nor did Felipe speak again. And
thus, in silence, they continued across the mesa and on up the canyon to the
little adobe in the settlement. Arrived before the house, Franke quickly
disappeared in the direction of his home, leaving Felipe to unhitch and
unharness alone. But Felipe cared nothing for this. He was supremely
happy&#8211;happy in the return of the long-lost colt, doubly happy in the
possession of so fine a horse without outlay of money. Whistling blithely, he
unhitched the team, led them back into the corral, returned to the wagon again.
Here, still whistling, he untied the black and escorted him also into the
inclosure. Then, after scratching his head a long moment in thought, he set out
in the direction of the general store and a bottle of <i>vino</i>.</p>

<p>As the man disappeared, Pat, standing uncertainly in the middle of the
corral, followed him with a look in his eyes that hinted of vague memories that
would not down. And well he might be flicked with vague memories. For he was at
last returned to the brief cradle of his babyhood.</p>

<p>Late that same afternoon, Helen, attired in riding-habit, left the house for
her first afternoon canter. As she slowly crossed the <i>patio</i>, she noted
the absence of Pat from his usual corner, but, assuming that he was inside the
stable, called to him from the gate. But she received no answering whinny.
Slightly worried, she entered the corral and stepped to the stable door, and
again sounded <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span> his
name. Again she received no answering whinny. She entered the stable, walked
past the stalls, peered in at each with increasing alarm. Only the saddle-horse
and the family horse met her troubled eyes. She stood for a moment dismayed,
then once more she sounded the horse&#8217;s name. But, as before, she received
no answering whinny.</p>

<p>Puzzled, perplexed, troubled with misgivings, yet refusing to believe the
worst, she fell to analyzing the thing. She knew that since coming to the ranch
Pat at no time had been outside the corral save in her charge. Also she recalled
that only a short hour or two before she had given him sweets and had talked
with him. Nor could the horse have strayed out of the inclosure, because she
remembered that the gate was latched when she had reached it. All these facts
flashed across her as she stood with grave eyes sweeping the stable. Finally she
stepped back to the door and gazed out into the sunlight of the corral; but, as
before, the inclosure was empty and silent, and now, somehow, forbidding. She
called again&#8211;called to the horse, called to the Mexican. But again came
only the echo of her voice, sounding hollow and solemn and plaintive through the
stable.</p>

<p>Suddenly her heart stopped beating. She remembered that the hostler had left
for town on foot early in the morning. And now her fears broke bounds. The horse
was gone! Some one had come in Miguel&#8217;s absence. Her Pat had been stolen!
He was gone for ever out of her life! <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_96'></a>96</span> Standing a moment, trembling with bitterness, she
darted out of the stable, out of the corral, across the <i>patio</i>. She sped
into the house and her father&#8217;s study, caught up the receiver of the
telephone.</p>

<p>And then, after a long time, the connection. And her father&#8217;s voice.
And her frantic inquiry. And the Judge&#8217;s smiling reply. And her recital of
the facts&#8211;pleading, pitiful, almost whimpering. And now the Judge&#8217;s
serious rejoinder. And then her imperious request that he come home. And the
Judge&#8217;s regretful reply&#8211;could not on account of pressing matters.
And then her tearful, choking outburst into the transmitter! And now suddenly
the wires crossing and a strange voice demanding that she get off. And with it
her utter collapse. She whirled away from the telephone, flung herself down upon
a couch, and gave way to a wild outburst of tears.</p>

<p>The thing <i>was</i> pitiful. The horse had occupied a very big place in her
life. And because that place now was empty, and because she saw no promise of
its ever being filled, she sobbed wretchedly a long time. Then, rising quietly,
she ascended the stairs to her room. Here she sank into a chair, one that
overlooked the corral, and began an analysis of the case, taking the affair up
from the very first day of Pat&#8217;s coming into her life. She did not go
further than that. Woman that she was, endowed with strongest intuitions and
insight, she knew she had sounded the mystery <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_97'></a>97</span> of his disappearance, had sounded it as clearly as
though she had been present.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pat&#8217;s rightful owners have found him and put in their
claim!&#8221; She got up and began to pace the floor. &#8220;I know it,&#8221;
she declared with conviction. &#8220;I know it as well as I know I&#8217;m in
this room. Pat&#8211;Pat has been&#8211;been taken and&#8211;and&#8211;&#8221;
Tears choked back her words. Again she turned to her bed and gave way to a
paroxysm of grief.</p>

<p>Her tears lasted until sleep mercifully descended. And thus she lay,
outstretched and disheveled, until the sun, slanting across the room, settled
its mellow rays upon her. And even though the touch was light and gentle and
somehow sympathetic, it awoke her. She rose and hurried to a window. Out in the
corral all was quiet. She dropped into a chair and turned her eyes to the
east&#8211;out over the mesa to the distant mountains. The mountains were draped
in their evening purple, which seemed to her like mourning for her lost
happiness&#8211;a happiness that might have been hers always with the horse.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span><a id='link_9'></a>CHAPTER IX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE SECOND GREAT LESSON</span></h2>

<p>Next morning Pat, imprisoned in a tiny stable, tried to get out by thrusting
his head against the door. But the door would not give. Alone in semi-darkness,
therefore, he spent the day. Twice a Mexican youth came to feed and water him,
but always the quantity was insufficient, and always the boy carefully locked
the door after him. Because of this, together with the poor ventilation, Pat
became irritable. He longed for the freedom of the big corral&#8211;its
sunlight, the visits of his mistress&#8211;but these were steadfastly denied
him. And so through another night and another day, until he became well-nigh
distracted. He stamped the floor, fought flies, dozed, dreamed strange dreams,
stamped the floor again. After three days of this, sounds outside told him of
the return of man and horses. But not till the next morning, and then quite
late, was he released from the odious confinement.</p>

<p>Felipe bustled in, all eager for business. He drove his recent acquisition
out into the corral and set to work harnessing one of the team&#8211;the mate of
the aged mare. When she was bridled <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_99'></a>99</span> and standing in the trail in front of his empty
wagon, he hurriedly returned to the new horse, placed a bridle upon his head,
led him forth, and swung him close beside the other horse. He winced just a
little at the incongruity of the team, though he did not let it delay him. He
picked up the half of the harness and tossed it over the mare&#8217;s back. Then
he caught up the other half, and, preparing to toss it upon the black, began to
straighten out deep and unexpected tangles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you black devil,&#8221; he began, as he twisted and turned the
much-bepatched harness, &#8220;you doin&#8217; soom work now! All you&#8217;
life you havin&#8217; mooch good times! Eet is not for thee fun thot you live,
you know?&#8221; he went on, academically, continuing to disentangle the
harness. &#8220;Eet is for thee work thot you live! Work&#8211;thot&#8217;s thee
answer!&#8221; Then, having straightened the harness at last, with a grunt of
satisfaction he tossed it lightly up.</p>

<p>Instantly there was wild commotion. With a kick and a plunge the horse flung
off the harness.</p>

<p>Felipe stood dumfounded. It had never occurred to him that the horse was not
broken to harness. Horses reared as this one evidently had been reared ought
certainly to be educated to all kinds of service. Yet this horse evidently was
not. He scratched his head in perplexity. To break a horse to harness was no
child&#8217;s play, as he well knew. To break a horse of this character to
harness, as he well understood also, was a task that required exceptional
patience and hardihood. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_100'></a>100</span> What should he do? There was his constant press for
money. The aged mare having almost dropped in the trail the evening before, was
unfit for toil, and to break a horse to harness meant loss of time, and, as
every one knows, loss of time meant loss of money. So what should he do? He was
utterly at a loss.</p>

<p>Striding to the doorstep, he sat down and regarded the horse with malevolent
disgust. After a time, jerking off his hat savagely, he burst out into a
thundering tirade.</p>

<p>&#8220;You black devil! You haf give me more trouble than anyt&#8217;ing I haf ever
own&#8211;chickens, burro, pigs, horses, money&#8211;money, even&#8211;money I
haf owe thot robber Pedro! First you haf run away thot time! Then you haf mek me
steal you out of thot place couple days before! And now&#8221;&#8211;he suddenly
leaped to his feet&#8211;&#8220;now you haf mek me break you to thees wagon and
harness!&#8221; He advanced to the startled horse and brandished his fist.
&#8220;But I break you!&#8221; he snarled&#8211;&#8220;I break you like a horse
never was broke before! And&#8211;and if I don&#8217; break you&#8211;if you
don&#8217; do what I haf say&#8211;I break every bone inside!&#8221; With this
he began feverishly to peel off his coat.</p>

<p>And this is the lot of the dumb. Merely for not knowing what a man believed
he should know, Pat was to be humiliated, was to be punished far beyond justice
and decency. And because he was a horse abnormally highstrung and sensitive,
this punishment was to be doubly cruel. To him a blow was more painful than to
the average horse, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
even as a word of kindness sank deeper and remained longer to soften his memory.
On his maternal side he was the offspring of native stock, but he was blooded to
the last least end of him, and while from his mother he had inherited his softer
traits, like his affection for those who showed affection for him, it was from
his sire, unknown though he was, that he inherited an almost human spirit of
rebellion when driven by lash or harsh word, and also the strength to exercise
it. In the face of these qualities, then, he was to be broken to harness and a
wagon by a man!</p>

<p>Felipe lost little time in preparation. He set out through the settlement,
his destination a distant and kindly neighbor. He moved at a stride so vigorous
that the good townspeople, roused by the rare spectacle of a man in a hurry,
interrupted their passive loafing beside well and in doorway, and turned
wondering eyes after him. But if their eyes showed wonderment at his going, on
his return they showed amazement and a kind of horror. For Felipe, acting for
once in the capacity of work-horse, was straining along at the end of a huge
wagon-tongue affixed to a crude and mastodonic axle which in turn supported two
monolithic cart-wheels. It was a device by which he meant to break the horse to
harness, and, perspiring freely, and swearing even more freely, he dragged it
shrieking for grease through the settlement, really at work, but work which was
not to be admired. Reaching the clearing in front of his house, he dropped the
heavy <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span> tongue and
whipped out a red handkerchief with a sigh of relief. Also, as he wiped away the
perspiration on his forehead and neck and arms, he turned baleful eyes upon the
innocent cause of his toil.</p>

<p>&#8220;You black devil!&#8221; he growled, after a moment. &#8220;I feex you
now&#8211;bet you&#8217; life! And you can keeck&#8211;and keeck and keeck! You
don&#8217; worry thees cart mooch! You black devil!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he became active again. He strode back into the corral, sought out an
old harness and a huge collar, and dragged them forward into the trail. Flinging
them aside in the direction of the cart, he then turned to the mare, removed the
work-harness from her, and led her into position before the warlike vehicle.
Again perspiring freely, but losing no breath now in abusive talk, he quickly
harnessed her up and then strode forward to the black. After eying him narrowly
a moment, he seized his bridle and led him back alongside the mare, where he
proceeded nervously to harness him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We see now,&#8221; he began, as he picked up the massive collar.
&#8220;You can stond still&#8211;thot&#8217;s right! And maybe you can take
thees t&#8217;ing&#8211;we see!&#8221;</p>

<p>The collar was much too large for workaday use, but it was not too large for
this purpose. Its very size gave it freedom to pass over the head without the
usual twisting and turning. Nor did the horse rebel when it was so
placed&#8211;a fact which gave Felipe much relief, since he now believed <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span> that he would not have
the trouble he had anticipated. Also, with the collar in position, he was but a
moment in adjusting the hames, making fast the bottom strap, and hooking the
tugs securely. With everything in readiness he then caught up the reins and the
whip, and stepped away to begin the real work of breaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Haya!</i>&#8221; he cried, and touched up the off-horse. She
started forward, as always with this command from her master. But she did not go
far.</p>

<p>Pat was the cause of the delay. Understanding neither the contraption at his
heels, nor the word of command from the man, he held himself motionless and
pleasantly uninterested, gazing slowly about at the landscape. Nor did he offer
to move when the man cut him viciously with the whip. The lash pitted his tender
flesh and hurt mightily; but even though he now understood what was required of
him, he only became stubborn&#8211;bracing his legs and flattening his ears,
forcefully resisting the counter efforts of the mare beside him.</p>

<p>And this was his nature. Long before he had demonstrated that he would not be
governed by a whip. That day in the Richardses&#8217; corral, when he was broken
to saddle, cruelty alone would never have conquered him. Cruelty there had been,
and much of it; but with the cruelty there had been other things&#8211;evidence
of affection at the right moment, both in his mistress and in the men about him,
and these, coupled with quick understanding, had made the breaking a success.
And <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span> had there been
evidence of kindness now, somewhere revealed early by this man, Pat might have
drawn the cart as the straining mate at his side was attempting to draw it. But
there was no evidence of kindness, and as a result he remained stubborn and
wilful, standing braced and trembling, true in every particular to the spirit of
his forebears.</p>

<p>Nor was Felipe less true to the spirit within himself. Infuriated,
uncompromising, believing this to be merely the cussedness natural with the
native horses, he abandoned all hope of instant success and gave way to
brutality. Dropping the reins and reversing the whip in his hands, he began to
beat the horse unmercifully, bringing the heavy butt down again and again, each
mighty thwack echoing down the canyon. The result was inevitable. The horse
began to kick&#8211;straight back at first, then, finding his hoofs striking the
cart, he swung sideways to the tongue and kicked straight out. This last was
sudden, and narrowly missed Felipe, who leaped to one side. Then, unable to
reach the horse with the butt, he reversed the whip again and resumed his first
torture, that of pitting the legs of the horse with the lash.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keeck!&#8221; he snarled, continuing to swing the whip. &#8220;Keeck!
Keeck! I can keeck, too!&#8221; He swung his arm till it ached, when he
stopped.</p>

<p>Whereupon the horse settled down. But his eyes were ablaze and he was
trembling all over. Also, while undoubtedly suffering added distress from the
taut and binding traces, he continued <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_105'></a>105</span> to stand at right angles to the mare&#8211;head
high, nostrils quivering, mouth adrip with white slaver&#8211;until the spirit
of rebellion appeared to grip him afresh. With a convulsive heave he moved
again, making another quarter turn, which brought him clear of the tongue and
facing the vehicle. Then he set up a nervous little prancing, whisking his tail
savagely, now and again lifting his heels as if to strike. That was all. He
gained no ground forward, nor did it appear as if he would ever move
forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8211;you&#8211;&#8221; began Felipe, then subsided, evidently too
wrathful for words. And he remained silent, gazing wearily toward the
settlement, as though about to call assistance.</p>

<p>The stillness was heavy and portentous. Both horses were motionless. Felipe
continued silent. Off toward the settlement all was still. Overhead, the
early-morning sky pressed low, spotless and shimmering, brooding. Around and
about, the flies seemed to stop buzzing. Everywhere lurked the quiet. The earth
appeared bowed in humiliation, hushed in prayer as for the unfortunate one,
while up and down the trail, basking in world-old light, lay dust of centuries,
smug and contented in its quiescence. All nature was still, gripped in tense
quiet.</p>

<p>The crack of a whip broke it. Felipe, suddenly bestirring himself, had sprung
forward and dealt the horse a blow with the butt. Across the nose, it had
sounded hollow and distant; and the horse, whipping up his head in surprised
pain, now <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span> turned
upon the man a look at once sorrowful and terrible, a look which spelled death
and destruction. Nor did he only look. With a strange outcry, shrill and
piercing, awaking the canyon in unnatural echoes, he whirled in his harness and
reared, reared despite his harness, and struck out with venomous force. It was
quick as a lightning flash, but, quick as it was, Felipe avoided it. And it was
fortunate that he did. Terror-stricken and dropping the whip, he sped to the
rear, to a point behind the cart, and there turned amazed eyes at the
pirouetting horse.</p>

<p>What manner of horse was this, he asked himself. Could it be that this horse,
black as night, was truly of the lower regions? Certainly he looked it,
balancing there on his hind legs, with his reddened eyes and inflamed nostrils!
And&#8211;But what was this? From the corral had come a shrill nicker, the voice
of the aged mare. But that was not it! With the outcry, seemingly an answer to
the black&#8217;s maddened outcry, the black dropped to all-fours again, turning
quick ears and eyes in the direction of the sound! What manner of horse was
this, anyway? Never before had he seen such a horse! He felt himself go
limp.</p>

<p>There is a call in nature that sounds for life against death. It is a call
put forth in innumerable different tongues around the world, and it sounds
somewhere every second of the day and darkness&#8211;through jungles, across
swamps, down mountains, over plains, out of valleys. It is a cry of warning, a
cry to disarm foes. It is an <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_107'></a>107</span> outcry of good as against evil&#8211;the squawk of
a hen to her chicks, the bleat of a sheep to her lambs, the grunt of a sow to
her sucklings, the bellow of a cow to her calf, the purr of a cat to her
kittens, the whine of a dog to her puppies, the drum of a partridge to her
young. A cry from the heart to the heart, an appeal of flesh to its own flesh,
it is the world-old mother-call.</p>

<p>And the horse heard this call. He probably did not recognize in it a call of
the mother-heart, any more than it was possible for the aged mare to recognize
in his outcry the voice of her own flesh. What he did hear, no doubt, was the
voice of a friend, one who understood and pitied, and would help if it could
help. At any rate, he stood very still, seemingly grateful for the evidence of a
champion, seemingly anxious that it sound again. But it did not sound again. Yet
he made no further effort to give battle. He held to his attitude of intent
listening, ears cocked forward and eyes straining and tail at rest, until
Felipe, stung into action by an idea wrought out of all this, hastened out from
behind the cart and away in the direction of the corral. At sight of him the
horse became restless again, squaring himself once more to the mare, stamping
his feet and champing his bit nervously. He seemed to lose all recollection of
the outcry, all the peace it had engendered within him. Of such are the kingdom
of the dumb.</p>

<p>Possessed by his idea, an idea so brilliant that he himself marveled, Felipe
was not long in putting <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_108'></a>108</span> it to test. He hurriedly bridled the aged mare and
led her out into the trail. He placed her alongside the black&#8211;for reasons
which, had the <i>compadre</i> Franke been present, Felipe might have suggested
with a crafty wink&#8211;then hastily began to unhitch the team-mate. And it was
just here that he proved his foresight. In the work of unhitching the mate, he
should have encountered, and had expected, trouble from the black. But he did
not. The mare sounded another friendly nicker when arranged beside him, and the
black, pricking up his ears sharply, turned to her and proceeded to establish
his friendship by licking her. So Felipe did not meet with difficulty from that
direction; nor did he have trouble in the direction of the team-mate herself.
She seemed glad to be relieved from her unsuccessful task, and Felipe, glad to
relieve her in the light of his brilliant idea, led her off to one side quickly,
then returned and swung the old mare into her place. He hitched her up, picked
up the reins and whip, and set about with his test.</p>

<p>&#8220;We see now,&#8221; he began, his voice quiet and encouraging.
&#8220;Maybe you work wit&#8217; thee old woman! We see!&#8221; And he gave a
low command.</p>

<p>With the command Pat started forward, urged to it by the aged
mare&#8211;pulling more than his share of the load. Perhaps it was due to her
presence; perhaps to the note of kindness in Felipe&#8217;s voice. At any rate,
he moved, and he moved forward, and he moved with a steady pull. Yet he did not
proceed far. Though he did not stop <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_109'></a>109</span> through rebellion. It was simply to renew his
attentions to the old mare. He began to caress her as if he really recognized in
this rack of an animal his own lost mother. But recognition, of course, was
impossible. Long before, the only source of recognition, appeal made through
digestive organs, had disappeared. Nevertheless, he lavished upon her unwonted
affection until Felipe gently but firmly urged him forward again. Then again he
proceeded, pulling all of the load this time, bringing about a slack in the
traces of the mare and a consequent bumping of her hind legs against the cart
which seemed to awaken some of her dying spirit.</p>

<p>Up and down the trail they moved, the mare sedately, the horse actively,
prancing gaily, appearing to take gleeful pleasure in his task, until Felipe,
kindled with elation and pride, decided to drive on into the settlement and
there become the object of covetous eyes. Therefore he urged the team forward to
a point in front of the general store, where in lordly composure sat Pedro,
occupying his customary seat on an empty keg on the porch. At sight of him
Felipe&#8217;s joy leaped to the heavens, and he pulled up the team, ostensibly
to adjust a forward buckle, but in reality to afford Pedro an uninterrupted view
of the beautiful black. Moving forward to the head of the horses, he watched out
of the tail of his eye Pedro&#8217;s lazy survey of the team.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where you got thot horse?&#8221; inquired Pedro, after a long moment,
as he slowly removed a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_110'></a>110</span> cigarette from between his lips. &#8220;I
mean,&#8221; he added, &#8220;where you haf <i>steal</i> thot
<i>caballo</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>Felipe winced. But he did not immediately retort. He carried out his bluff,
unbuckling and buckling one of the straps, then mildly straightened up and faced
the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pedro,&#8221; he began, tensely, &#8220;you haf know&#8211;José, Juan,
Manuel, Francisco, Carlotta&#8211;all haf know&#8211;thot eet is only one t&#8217;ief
in all thees place! And thot man&#8211;thot t&#8217;ief&#8211;is Pedro
Garcia!&#8221;</p>

<p>Pedro grunted. &#8220;Where you haf steal thot horse?&#8221; he repeated,
without show of anger. &#8220;You can give me thot horse,&#8221; he continued,
placidly. &#8220;You haf owe me mooch money. I take thot horse for
payment&#8211;everyt&#8217;ing. You give thot <i>caballo</i> to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Felipe turned to the team. &#8220;I give you one keeck in thee belly!&#8221;
he roared. Then he touched up the horses and started back toward the house. Gone
was all elation, all pride, all gleeful consciousness of possession.</p>

<p>Gaining the clearing, he decided to try out the other horse with the black.
He realized that the aged mare was unfit, even though in the last hour she had
appeared greatly to improve, and he must accordingly match up a team. So he
unhitched her and swung the mate into place. He met with disagreeable surprise,
however. The black would not pull with this horse. Instead, he held himself
quietly at rest, gazing about sleepily over the landscape, a trick of his, as
Felipe had learned, when quietly rebelling. Felipe looked at him a <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span> moment, but did not try
to force him with tongue or lash. For he was coming to understand this horse,
and, concluding that sooner or later, under proper treatment, he would probably
accept duty with any mate, determined to abandon work for the day. Whereupon he
unhitched the horses and led them all back into the corral. Then he put up the
bars and set out in the direction of the settlement.</p>

<p>Which ended Pat&#8217;s second great lesson at the hand of man. He was sore
and somewhat stiff from the struggle, but he did not fret long over his
condition, for he soon awoke to the presence of that beside him in the corral
which caused him to forget himself completely. It was the worn-out structure of
skin and bones who had befriended him in his hour of trial. He gazed at her a
moment, then approached and fell to caressing her, showing in this attention his
power to forget self&#8211;aches, sores, troubles&#8211;in his affection and
gratitude toward all things warranting affection and gratitude.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span><a id='link_10'></a>CHAPTER X<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE STRANGER AGAIN</span></h2>

<p>Meantime, Helen was becoming desperate over her loss. Unwilling to accept the
theory of her household, which was that Pat had been stolen by a band of
organized thieves and ere this was well out of the neighborhood and probably the
county, she had held firmly to her original idea, <i>viz.</i>, that the horse
was in the possession of his rightful owners, and so could not be far out of the
community. Therefore, the morning following his disappearance, having with sober
reflection lightened within her the seriousness of it all, she had set out in
confident search for him, mounted on her brown saddler. But though she had
combed the town and the trails around the town, quietly interviewing all such
teamsters and horsemen as might by any chance know something about it, yet in
answer to her persistent inquiries all she had received was a blank shake of the
head or an earnest expression of willingness to assist her. So, because she had
continued her search for three days without success, inquiring and peering into
every nook and corner of the community, she finally had come to regard her quest
as hopeless, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span> and
to become more than ever an image of despair.</p>

<p>The evening of the fourth day there was a dance. It was one of the regular
monthly affairs, and because Helen was a member of the committee she felt it her
duty to attend. One of the young men, accompanied by his mother and sister,
drove out for her, but she left the house with reluctance and a marked
predisposition not to enjoy herself. But she forgot this when she presently
beheld the young man from the East whom she had encountered on the mesa. He was
standing close beside a rather frail little woman, undoubtedly his mother, who
with the matrons of the town was seated near a fireplace watching the dancers.
He was introduced. Later they sat out one of his numbers alone together in a
corner behind some potted palms. In the course of their conversation Helen
informed him of the disappearance of her horse, and asked him, as she asked
everybody she met now, if he knew anything or had heard anything concerning the
loss. The young man knew nothing of the great disappearance, however, though he
did offer it as his belief that a horse of Pat&#8217;s obvious value could not
long remain in obscurity. This was encouraging, and Helen felt herself become
hopeful again. But when he offered his services in the search, as he did
presently, she felt not only hopeful again, but somehow quite certain now that
it would all be cleared up. For there was that in this young gentleman which
caused confidence. What she <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_114'></a>114</span> told him, however, was that she was grateful for
his offer, and should be greatly pleased to have him with her.</p>

<p>And thus it was that, on the morning of the fifth day, Helen Richards and
Stephen Wainwright&#8211;the young man&#8217;s name&#8211;together with two of
Helen&#8217;s close friends, were riding slowly across the mesa, alert for any
combination in harness which might reveal the lost Pat. Helen and Stephen were
well in the lead, and Helen had broken the silence by addressing Stephen as a
native, recalling their first meeting. Whereupon the young man, smiling quietly,
had wanted to know why; but after she had explained that it was because he had
enlisted himself in the search for a horse, adding that in doing so he had
conformed with one of the unwritten laws of the country, he still confessed
himself in the dark. This had been but a moment before, and she now settled
herself to explain more fully.</p>

<p>&#8220;A horse is, or was, our most valued property,&#8221; she began.
&#8220;I reckon the past tense is better&#8211;though we&#8217;ll never quite
live down our interest in horses.&#8221; She smiled across at him. &#8220;Long
ago,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;in the days of our Judge Lynch, you know, a
stolen horse meant a hanged man&#8211;or two or three&#8211;as not infrequently
happened. But all that is history now. Yet the feeling remains. And whenever one
of our horses disappears&#8211;it is rare now&#8211;we all take it more or less
as a personal loss. In your willingness to <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_115'></a>115</span> help find Pat, therefore, you declare yourself one
of us&#8211;and are gladly admitted.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rode along in silence. &#8220;Why was the feeling so intense in the old
days?&#8221; he inquired, after a time.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was due to physical conditions,&#8221; she replied&#8211;&#8220;the
geography of the country. Water-holes were few and very far apart, and to get
from one to another often entailed a journey impossible to a man without a
horse. To steal his horse, therefore, was to deprive him of his sole means of
getting to water&#8211;practically to deprive him of his life. If he
didn&#8217;t die of thirst, which frequently he did, at best it was a very grave
offense. It isn&#8217;t considered so now&#8211;not so much so, at any
rate&#8211;unless in the desert wastes to the west of us. Yet the feeling still
lurks within us, and a stolen horse is a matter that concerns the whole
community.&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded thoughtfully, but remained silent. Suddenly Helen drew rein. Before
her was a horned toad, peculiarly a part of the desert, blinking up at them
wickedly. He drew rein and followed her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;A horned toad, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen shook her head. &#8220;Are you interested in such things?&#8221; she
inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;In a way&#8211;yes,&#8221; he affirmed, doubtfully. &#8220;Though I
can&#8217;t see good reason for their existence.&#8221; His eyes twinkled.
&#8220;Can you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen was thoughtful a moment. &#8220;Well, no,&#8221; she admitted, finally.
&#8220;Yet there must be a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_116'></a>116</span> good reason. Reptiles must live for some good
purpose. All things do&#8211;don&#8217;t you think?&#8221; Then, before he could
make a rejoinder, she went on: &#8220;I sometimes feel that these creatures were
originally placed here to encourage other and higher forms of life to come and
locate in the desert&#8211;were placed here, in other words, to prove that life
is possible in all this desolation.&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced at her. &#8220;Certainly it has worked out that way, at any
rate,&#8221; he ventured. &#8220;Good old Genesis!&#8221; He smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to have,&#8221; she agreed, thoughtfully. &#8220;Because you
and I are here. But it goes a long way back&#8211;to Genesis&#8211;yes.
Following the initial placing, other and higher organisms, finding in their
migratory travels this evidence of life, accepted the encouragement to remain,
and did remain, feeding upon the life found here in the shape of toads and
lizards&#8211;to carry the theory forward a step&#8211;even as the toads and
lizards&#8211;to carry it back again&#8211;fed upon the insects which they in
their turn found here. Then along came other forms of life, higher in the cosmic
setting, and these, finding encouragement in the presence of the earlier
arrivals, fed upon them and remained. And so on up, to the forerunners of our
present-day animals&#8211;coyotes and prairie-dogs. And after these, primitive
man&#8211;to find encouragement in the coyotes and prairie-dogs&#8211;and to
feed upon them and remain. Then after primitive man, the second type&#8211;the
brown man; and after the brown man, the red man; and after the red man, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span> white
man&#8211;all with an eye to sustenance, and finding it, and
remaining.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stephen&#8217;s eyes swept around the desert absently. He knew&#8211;this
young man&#8211;that he was in the presence of a personality. For he could not
help but draw comparisons between the young woman beside him and the young women
of his acquaintance in the East. While he had found Eastern girls vivacious, and
attractive with a kind of surface charm, never had he known one to take so quiet
and unassuming an outlook upon so broad a theme. It was the desert, he told
himself. Here beside him was a type unknown to him, and one so different from
any he had as yet met with, he felt himself ill at ease in her presence&#8211;a
thing new to him, too&#8211;and which in itself gave him cause to marvel. Yes,
it was the desert. It <i>must</i> be the desert! In this slender girl beside him
he saw a person of insight and originality, a girl assuredly not more than
twenty years of age, attractive, and thoroughly feminine. How ever did they do
it?</p>

<p>He harked back in his thoughts to her theory. And he dwelt not so much upon
the theory itself as upon her manner of advancing it. Running back over these
things, recalling the music of her voice, together with her spoken musings, he
came to understand why, with that first encounter, he had found himself almost
instantly curious concerning desert folk. Not that he had known why at the time,
or had given that phase of it consideration. He did remember that he had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span> strongly impressed
by the way she had managed her bolting horse. But aside from that, there had
been something in her personality, an indefinable calm and sureness, a grip upon
herself, that he had felt the very first moment. Undoubtedly all this had
flicked him into a novel curiosity. He pulled himself together with an
effort.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like your theory,&#8221; he answered, smiling. &#8220;And it must be
true, because I am told horned toads are fast disappearing. Evidently they have
served their purpose. But tell me,&#8221; he concluded, &#8220;what is becoming
of them? Where are they going?&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed. &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you that. Perhaps they just vanish
into the fourth&#8211;or maybe the fifth&#8211;dimension!&#8221;</p>

<p>And this was the other side of her, a side he had come to learn while with
her at the dance, and which made her lovable as well as admirable. But she was
speaking again, and again was serious.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have yet another theory,&#8221; she said&#8211;&#8220;one as to why
these creatures are here, you know.&#8221; She smiled across at him. &#8220;It
is all my very own, too! It is that in their presence among us&#8211;among
mankind&#8211;they unwittingly develop us through thought. Thinking exercises
the brain, we are told, and exercising the brain makes for
world-advancement&#8211;we are told.&#8221; Then, suddenly, &#8220;I hope you
don&#8217;t think me silly&#8211;Mr. Native?&#8221;</p>

<p>But he remained sober. &#8220;Tell me,&#8221; he asked, after a time,
&#8220;what it is about this country&#8211;I mean other than friendships, of
course&#8211;that <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
gets under a fellow&#8217;s soul and lifts it&#8211;to the end that he wants to
remain here? I know there is something, though I can&#8217;t for the life of me
place it. What is it, anyway?&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned upon him sharply. &#8220;Do you really feel that way?&#8221; she
asked, evidently pleased.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel that way. But why do I feel that way? What is it? You know what
I mean. There is something&#8211;there must be!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what you mean&#8211;yes,&#8221; she replied, thoughtfully.
&#8220;Yet I doubt if I myself, even after all these years, can define it. What
you &#8216;feel&#8217; must be our atmosphere&#8211;its rarity, its power to
exhilarate. Though that really doesn&#8217;t explain it. I reckon it&#8217;s the
same thing&#8211;only much more healthful, more soulful&#8211;that one feels in
large cities after nightfall. I mean, the glare of your incandescent lights. I
honestly believe that that glare, more than any other single thing, holds
throngs of people to an existence not only unnatural, but laden with a something
that crushes as well.&#8221; She was silent.</p>

<p>Again Stephen felt the strange pull on his interest, but he said nothing.
After a time she went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;City-dwellers,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;don&#8217;t begin their
day till the approach of dark. It&#8217;s true of both levels of society,
too&#8211;lower as well as upper. And I believe the reason for this lies, as I
have said, in the atmosphere&#8211;their man-made atmosphere&#8211;just as the
secret of your feeling the way you do lies in our atmosphere&#8211;God-made.
Were <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span> this
atmosphere suddenly to disappear, both out of your cities and out of my deserts,
both your world and my own would lose all of their charm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stephen bestirred himself. &#8220;What psychology do you find in that?&#8221;
he asked, dwelling upon the fact that she knew his East so well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Merely the effect of softening things&#8211;for the soul as well as
the eye&#8211;through the eye, indeed, to the soul. Our atmosphere here does
that&#8211;softens the houses, and the trees, and the cattle, and the mountains,
and the distant reaches. It softens our nights, too. Perhaps you have noticed
it? How everything appears shrouded in a kind of hazy, mellow, translucent
something that somehow reacts upon you? I have. And I believe that is the secret
of one&#8217;s wanting to remain in the country, once he has exposed himself to
it. It is a kind of spell&#8211;a hypnosis. When out of it one wants to get back
into it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know I felt it when I was East, attending school,&#8221; she went
on, quietly. &#8220;Living always in this atmosphere, I somehow had forgotten
its charm&#8211;as one will forget all subtle beauty unless frequently and
forcibly reminded of it. But in the East I missed it, and found myself restless
and anxious to get back into it. Indeed, I felt that I must get back or die! So
one day, when your Eastern spirit of sudden change was upon me, I packed and
came home. It was a year short of my degree, too. But I could not remain away
another day&#8211;simply had to get back&#8211;and back <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span> I came. My degree&#8211;my
sheepskin&#8221;&#8211;she was smiling&#8211;&#8220;couldn&#8217;t hold
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ve spent some time in the East?&#8221; he asked,
tentatively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;that much&#8211;three years. And I
didn&#8217;t like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; he asked, a little surprised.</p>

<p>She regarded him curiously. He saw a look of mild annoyance in her eyes, one
that seemed to tell of her inability to understand so needless a question.</p>

<p>&#8220;I just didn&#8217;t,&#8221; she rejoined, after a moment. &#8220;I
discovered that you Easterners value things which are diametrically opposite to
the things we value, and that you value not at all those things which we value
most of all.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had to laugh. &#8220;What are they?&#8221; he wanted to know.</p>

<p>For an instant she showed shyness. &#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t say,&#8221; she
declared, finally. &#8220;Some day I may tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stephen realized that it must be serious. He was hesitating whether to press
her further, when he saw her tighten her reins, put spurs to her horse, and go
flashing off in the direction of the mountain trail. As she dashed off he heard
her call out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pat!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Pat! It&#8217;s Pat!&#8221; Then she
glanced to the rear. &#8220;Adele! Sam! It&#8217;s Pat! Come, quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>Stephen spurred on with the others. He galloped after this hard-riding
girl&#8211;so intensely <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_122'></a>122</span> alive&#8211;a girl past his understanding. Over
dunes and across flats he charged, followed closely by the others, urging his
horse to his utmost. But, try as he might, he could not overtake her or even
lessen the distance between them, so furious was her race for her lost horse.
Finally he burst out upon the trail and drew rein beside her, standing with the
others in the path of an oncoming wood-wagon, anxiously awaiting its slow
approach.</p>

<p>It was a curious outfit. One of the team, an aged and decrepit horse, was
laboring along with head drooping and hoofs scuffling the trail, while beside
it, with head erect and nostrils aquiver and hoofs lifting eagerly, stepped the
glorious Pat! Both horses were draped in a disreputable harness, crudely patched
with makeshift string and wire, and both were covered with a fine coating of
dust. Atop all this, high and mighty upon an enormous load of wood, sat a
Mexican, complacently smoking a cigarette and contentedly swinging his heels,
evidently elated with this prospect of parading his horse before a group of
Americans. But as he drew close a look of uneasiness crept over him, and he
pulled up his team and shrugged his shoulders, as a preliminary, no doubt, to
disappearance behind the Mexican shield of &#8220;No sabe!&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen swung close to him. There was a choice between a contest and diplomatic
concession. She decided to offer to purchase the horse at once, believing this
to be the easiest way out of the trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Señor</i>,&#8221; she began in Spanish, &#8220;<i>deseo comprar</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span> <i>aquel caballo
negro. Puedo pagar cualquire cantidad razonable por el. Se perdio y nosotros lo
cuidamos, y he aprendido a quererlo mucho. Si usted quiere venderlo me haria un
gran favor. Siento mucho que me lo hayan quitado.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The Mexican looked relieved. He slowly removed his hat with true Castilian
courtesy.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Señorita</i>,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;<i>lo venderia con gusto
pero pienso que me paga lo que quiero por el</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Which delighted Helen. &#8220;<i>Pagare lo que sea.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The Mexican hesitated a moment. &#8220;<i>¿Pagara cuarenta pesos?</i>&#8221;
he asked, finally. &#8220;<i>Yo tambien quiero al caballo mucho</i>,&#8221; he
added. &#8220;<i>Pero por cuarenta pesos pienso&#8211;pienso que lo
olvido.</i>&#8221; And he grinned.</p>

<p>Helen turned to the others. For Stephen&#8217;s benefit she explained what
had been said, and the men promptly offered to make up the required forty
dollars. Helen turned to the Mexican, accepted his price, and requested him to
release Pat from the harness. Whereat the Mexican smiled broadly; shrugged his
shoulders suddenly; forgot his rôle of &#8220;No sabe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How,&#8221; he burst out&#8211;&#8220;how I&#8217;m gettin&#8217;
thees wagon to town? I&#8217;m pullin&#8217; eet myself?&#8221;</p>

<p>The others laughed. Then Helen, deciding upon another arrangement, instructed
him to drive forward. She could see her father in town, she explained to the
others, and there also, after the exchange of money, the Mexican could purchase
another horse. Which closed the matter. The Mexican started the team forward,
while <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span> the others
fell in alongside, ranging themselves on either side. Thus they journeyed into
town&#8211;a strange cavalcade&#8211;Pat prancing, the mare drooping, the
Mexican visibly pleased, the others gratified by their unexpected success. In
town they turned into a side street, and there Helen left them, going off in the
direction of her father&#8217;s office. When she returned, the Judge was with
her. He read the Mexican a brief but stern lecture on the law pertaining to the
recovery of lost property, and closed the deal. Whereupon the wood-hauler
unharnessed Pat, bestowed him smilingly upon Helen, and took himself off,
evidently in quest of another horse, for he headed straight as a plumb-line for
the city pound.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>Pat was home again. He knew it from many things&#8211;the white fence, the
clean stable, the Mexican hostler with broom in hand. And though he was at home
where he wanted to be, yet he found himself filled with vague uneasiness. After
a time he sought to relieve it. He made his way into the stable, but he found no
relief there. He returned to the corral, and began slowly to circle inside the
fence, but neither did this relieve him. Finally he took up his old stand in the
sunlit corner, where he fell to listening with ears and eyes attentive to least
sounds. But even this did not relieve him.</p>

<p>Nor would anything ever relieve him. Never would he find absolute solace from
his inner disquiet. For what he sought and could not find, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span> what he listened for and could not
hear, was another of those sounds which had relieved the tedium of his brief
stay in the mountains, the friendly nicker of the aged mare, gone to toil out
her life in the racking treadmill between town and mountain.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span><a id='link_11'></a>CHAPTER XI<br /><span class='h2fs'>LOVE REJECTED</span></h2>

<p>Pat had just been clipped. And never was there a horse nearer perfection!
Shorn of all hair, his splendid physique, now in fullest maturity, stood out
clean-cut and fascinating.</p>

<p>In weight he might have tipped the scales at ten hundred pounds. In color his
skin, which now showed clearly, was a shade darker than that of the elephant,
but it showed the richness of velvet. His body through the trunk was round and
symmetrical; his haunches were wide without projection of the hip-bones; and his
limbs, the stifle and lower thigh, were long and strong and fully developed.
Added to these, he was high in the withers, the line of back and neck curving
perfectly; his shoulders were deep and oblique; and his long, thick fore arm,
knotty with bulging sinews, told of powerful muscles. And finally, his knees
across the pan were wide, the cannon-bone below thin and short, the pasterns
long and sloping, and the hoofs round and dark and neatly set on. While over
all&#8211;over the small, bony head, beautiful neck and shoulders&#8211;over the
entire body, clear down to the hoofs&#8211;ran a network of <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span> veins like those on the back of a leaf,
only more irregular&#8211;veins which stood out as though the skin were but thin
parchment through which the blood might burst. A rare horse, rare in any
country, doubly rare in this land of the small Spanish product, was the rating
given to Pat by men trained to judge value at sight. And so widespread did this
appraisal become, along trail, beside camp-fire, in bunk-house, that it was
known throughout the length and breadth of the Territory, and beyond the
Territory, that Judge Richards was the owner of a horse the like of which never
had been seen south of the Pecos.</p>

<p>For several days after the clipping, Helen did not choose to ride. So Pat was
permitted the doubtful pleasure of loafing about in the inclosure. Then one
morning, when the winter day was unusually warm, he awoke to a great clatter of
hoofs outside the corral. Directly he saw a party of young people, men and girls
under the chaperonage of a comely matron, dismounting in high spirits. As the
party swung down he saw his mistress appear from the house, attired in her
riding-habit, and, understanding the object of all this, since these parties had
become frequent in the past two months, he pressed close to the fence, anxious
to be off. The Mexican bridled and saddled him; his mistress and the others
mounted; soon all clattered out upon the river-trail.</p>

<p>The day was beautiful, and Helen, riding, as usual, beside Stephen, both in
the rear, enjoyed the morning keenly. Overhead, out of a shimmering <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span> azure sky, the sun
beamed mildly down, penetrating the chill of the morning, yet leaving enough
tang to bring a bloom to their cheeks. On their left the river, high with melted
snows from the north, moved in slow eddies near the shore, quicker eddies away
from the shore, steady and swift flow in the middle&#8211;a changing,
fascinating panorama. There fell a long silence before she turned to the young
man beside her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Native,&#8221; she began, smiling, &#8220;I hope you
don&#8217;t mean to bury yourself this morning! For more than a month you have
had very little to say to me. I don&#8217;t like it, because I can&#8217;t
understand it, and so I won&#8217;t have it!&#8221; Then she became serious.
&#8220;Whatever is the matter, Stephen?&#8221;</p>

<p>Pat, walking slowly beside the unfriendly horse, was attentive. He heard his
mistress&#8217;s voice, and somehow knew she was troubled. Then directly he had
positive proof of this, for she suddenly began to stroke his neck and shoulders.
Always she did this when thoughtful, but though he strained his ears for further
sounds of her voice, he did not hear her. What he did hear presently was the
voice of the young man, and having learned long before to discriminate between
different shades of the human voice, he knew from its low and tense quality that
the topic was a vital one. He listened sharply, heedful of any least change of
intonation that might be interpreted as a climax. But instead he was relieved
presently to hear the voice of his mistress again, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span> breaking in upon the low, constrained
tones of the young man.</p>

<p>Pat held his ears steadily back. He noted that her voice was well under
control, and she appeared to be answering the young man. Also, it was quite
evident that she was not accepting his argument, whatever it was. Yet her voice
took on many delicate changes. Sometimes he heard a note of pleading; again,
mild exasperation; and once a falling inflection which hinted at sadness. So it
continued, his mistress talking as he had never heard her talk before, until the
group ahead drew rein and wheeled, indicating their intention of returning. Then
once more the voice of his mistress changed suddenly and became light, even gay,
leaving Pat, as he himself was turned around, a very much mystified horse.</p>

<p>Yet this gaiety did not last. When they were well on their way back toward
the ranch, with the sun higher and brighter in the heavens, and the trail
correspondingly whiter and more dazzling to the eye, he found himself listening
to grave tones again&#8211;the voice of the young man. He talked steadily now,
his flow of words always tense, though occasionally interrupted by the other
with a quiet rejoinder. Then suddenly he ceased altogether, and Pat, acutely
conscious of the silence which descended upon them, was relieved when it was
broken by sounds of laughter ahead. Still the pair above him did not speak. Each
appeared to be adrift on a sea of thought the like of which he had never known.
And it continued, this ominous <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_130'></a>130</span> silence, and became heavier, until he saw the ranch
loom up ahead. Then he felt his mistress urge him into a canter that she might
join the others for the parting. But when the party broke up, as it did with
much good feeling, and he found himself turned loose to one side, with his
mistress and the young man walking into the shade of a cottonwood, he found
himself forced, since he now was out of range of their voices, to forego any
further listening, keenly against his desires. So he gave it all up as a bad
job.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stephen,&#8221; began Helen, seating herself upon a hummock of earth,
&#8220;I am sorry&#8211;sorry beyond words&#8211;that it has turned out this
way! I must admit that I like you&#8211;like you very much! But&#8211;but I am
afraid it is not the sort of liking you ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was seated beside her, reclining upon one elbow, absently thrusting the
tip of his riding-whip into a tuft of grass. And now again, as before that
morning, he told her of his very great love for her, his deep voice vibrant with
emotion, grimly acknowledging himself as unworthy of her, yet asking with rare
simplicity that she take him anyway, take him in spite of his unworthiness,
declaring it as his belief she would find him in time worthy&#8211;that he would
try to make himself worthy&#8211;<i>would</i> make himself worthy&#8211;would
overcome those faults which evidently&#8211;though she had not as yet told him
what they were&#8211;made him impossible in her eyes. Then suddenly he asked her
to tell him precisely what these <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_131'></a>131</span> faults were. He knew that he had many and could
only blame himself for them. But which of them did she find chiefly
objectionable? He was pitiable in his pleading.</p>

<p>But Helen shook her head. &#8220;I&#8211;I can&#8217;t tell you,
Stephen,&#8221; she declared, her voice breaking. &#8220;It&#8211;it is too much
to ask of&#8211;of any girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose, turning toward the distant mountains, bright and smiling in their
noonday splendor. As his eyes dwelt upon them in brooding silence, Helen gained
her feet. And, aware of her great part in this wretchedness, she took his hand
very gently in her own. Subtly conscious of the touch, realizing the tumult in
his soul, she found herself suddenly alive to a feeling within her deeper than
mere pity and sympathy. It was the anguish preceding tears. Quickly withdrawing
her hand, she turned and fled to the house. Inside, she slowly approached a
window. He was leading Pat into the corral; and, watching him unsaddle and
unbridle her horse, her treasure, she awoke to something else within her, a
strange swelling of her heart, different from anything she had ever known. It
was like ownership; it was a something as of maternal pride, a something new to
her which she could not fathom. She turned away. When she looked out again, her
eyes dry and burning, he was riding slowly along the trail toward town.</p>

<p>It was the beginning of the end. Winter passed, with horses abandoned for the
delights, swift-following, of dinner and dance and house party. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span> These affairs made deep
inroads upon Helen&#8217;s time, and so Pat was left pretty much to his own
reflections.</p>

<p>Yet he managed to fill the days to his satisfaction. Standing in the stable,
he loved to watch the snow-capped mountains, and the tiny white clouds scudding
around them, and the mellow radiance of golden sunlight streaming over them.
Also, gazing out of the little square window, he spent long periods in viewing
the hard brown of the nearer mesaland&#8211;the dips and dunes and thread-like
arroyos, with an occasional horseman crawling between. Or else, when he found
himself yearning for his mistress, he would turn eyes upon the house, and with
lazy speculation regard its sun-flecked windows, tightly shut doors, and smoking
chimneys, in the hope that she might step forth. Then came more mild weather
when he would spend long hours outside the stable, in his corner in the corral,
there to renew his silent vigil over nature and the house from this vantage.
Thus he filled his days, and found them not so long as formerly in his babyhood,
when each hour was fraught with so many little things that demanded his closest
interest and attention.</p>

<p>Nights found him early at rest. But not all nights. Nights there were when
the house would be lighted from cellar to garret, when spectral forms would move
in and out of doors, and when shadows would flicker across drawn shades. Such
nights were always his nights, for he would hear sounds of merriment, and voices
lifted in song, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
and above the voices, tinkling toward him on the crisp air, the music of a
piano. Such nights were his nights, for he knew that his mistress was happy, and
he would force open the stable door, step out under the cold stars, and take up
his stand in his corner, there to rest his head upon the topmost board and turn
steady eyes upon the scene of merriment until the last guest had departed.</p>

<p>Always on these nights, with wintry chills coursing down his legs or
rollicking along his spine, he found himself wanting to be a part of this
gaiety, wanting to enter the house, where he instinctively knew it was warm and
comfortable, where he might nuzzle the whole gathering for sugar and apples. But
this he could not do. He could only turn longing eyes upon the cottage and stand
there until, all too soon, sounds of doors opening and closing, together with
voices in cheery farewell, told him that the party was at an end. Then he would
see mysterious forms flitting across to the trail, and lights in the house
whisking out one by one, until the cottage gradually became engulfed in
darkness. Then, but not till then, would he turn away from his corner, walk back
slowly into the stable, and, because of the open door, which he could open but
never close, suffer intensely from the cold throughout the long night.</p>

<p>One such occasion, when the round moon hung poised in the blue-black dome of
heaven, and he was standing as usual in his corner, with eyes upon the
brilliantly lighted house, he became suddenly aware of two people descending the
rear porch <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span> and
making slowly toward him. At first he did not recognize his own mistress and the
young man who had been her almost constant companion since that memorable fright
on the mesa eight months before. But as they drew closer, and he came to know
the slender form in white, he sounded a soft whinny of greeting and pressed
eagerly close to the fence. The pair came near, very near; but neither of them
paid the least attention to him&#8211;a fact which troubled him deeply. And
directly his mistress spoke, but, as she was addressing herself to the young
man, this troubled him even more. But he could listen, and listen he did.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stephen,&#8221; she was saying, &#8220;you <i>must</i> accept my
answer as final. For you must know, Stephen,&#8221; she went on, quietly,
&#8220;that I have not changed toward you. My answer to-night, and my answer
to-morrow night, and my answer for ever, in so far as I can see, will be what it
was last autumn. I am more than sorry that this is so. But it is so,
nevertheless.&#8221; She was firm, though Pat, knowing her well, knew that it
required all the force of her trembling soul to give firmness to her words.</p>

<p>Stephen felt something of this as he stood beside her in grim meekness. With
his hungry eyes upon her, he felt the despair of one sunk to utter depths, of a
man mentally and physically broken. For he loved this girl. And it was this
love, God-given, that made him persist. In the spell of this love he realized
that he was but a weak agent, uttering demands given him to utter, and unable,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span> through a force as
mighty as Nature herself, to do otherwise. Yet though he was utterly torn apart,
he was able, despite this mighty demand within him, to understand her viewpoint.
He had understood it from the first. But the craving within would not let him
accept it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; he rejoined, &#8220;that the one decent course for
me would be to drop all this. But somehow I can&#8217;t. I love you that way,
Helen! Don&#8217;t you understand? I cannot let go! I seem to be forced
repeatedly to make&#8211;make a boor of myself!&#8221; There was a
moment&#8217;s silence. &#8220;Yet I have resisted it,&#8221; he went on.
&#8220;I have fought it&#8211;fought it with all the power I have! But I&#8211;I
somehow&#8211;cannot let go!&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen said nothing. She herself was coming to realize fully the depths of
this man&#8217;s passion. She knew&#8211;knew as few women have known&#8211;that
here was a man who wanted her; but she knew also, and she was sorry to know it,
that she could not conscientiously give herself to him. She regretted it not
alone for his sake, but for her own as well. She liked him, liked him better
than any other man she had ever known. But she knew that she could not marry
him, and believed in her heart that her reasons for refusing him were just
reasons. But she remained silent, true to her decision.</p>

<p>When Stephen spoke again it was not to plead with her; he seemed at last to
have accepted her refusal for all time. But he asked her reason for absolutely
refusing him&#8211;not that it mattered <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_136'></a>136</span> much now, since he faced the inevitable, but
thought the knowledge might in future guide and strengthen him. He talked
rapidly, hinting at beliefs and idolatries, comparing West with East, and East
with West, while he stood motionless, one hand upon the fence&#8211;earnest,
sincere, strong in his request. When he had uttered his last sad word, Helen
found herself, as she searched his drawn profile pityingly, no more able to deny
him an answer than at the time of their first chance meeting she could have
controlled the fate which had brought it about.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stephen,&#8221; she burst out, &#8220;I will tell you&#8211;though I
don&#8217;t want to tell you&#8211;remember! And if in the telling,&#8221; she
hurried on, &#8220;I prove rather too candid&#8211;please stop me! You will,
won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded listlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;To begin with,&#8221; she began, quietly, dreading her task, &#8220;we
as a people are selfish. We are isolated here&#8211;are far from the center of
things&#8211;but only certain things. We are quite our own center in certain
other ways. But we are selfish as regards advancement, and being selfish in this
way&#8211;being what we are and where we are&#8211;we live solely for that
advancement&#8211;for the privilege of doing what we will, and of knowing! It is
the first law of the country down here&#8211;of my people! We have aims and
aspirations and courage all peculiar to ourselves. And when we meet your type,
as I met you, we come&#8211;(Now, stop me when I get too severe!)&#8211;we come
to know our <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span> own
values a little better&#8211;to respect ourselves, perhaps&#8211;though perhaps,
too, I shouldn&#8217;t say it&#8211;a little more. Not that you lack virtues,
you Easterners, but they differ from ours&#8211;and probably only in kind. And
exactly what your type is you yourself have made plain to me during our many
little trips together in the saddle. And&#8211;and now I fear I must become even
more personal,&#8221; she broke off. &#8220;And I am very sorry that I must.
Though I know you will forgive me. You will, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; And she
looked up at him wistfully. &#8220;You thought it might benefit you to know.
This is only my opinion. Others may not see it this way. But I am giving it for
what it is, and I am giving it only because you asked it and have asked it
repeatedly.&#8221;</p>

<p>He roused himself. &#8220;Go on,&#8221; he said, with evident forced
lightness. &#8220;I see your viewpoint perfectly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she resumed, hurriedly, &#8220;you lack ambition&#8211;a
real ambition. You have ridden horses, played tennis, idled about clubs. You
were a coddled and petted child, a pampered and spoiled youth. You attended a
dozen schools, and, to use your own language, were &#8216;canned&#8217; out of all of
them. Which about sums up your activities. You have idled your time away, and
you give every promise of continuing. I regret that I must say that, but I
regret more deeply that it is true. You have many admirable qualities. You have
the greatest of all qualities&#8211;power for sincere love. But in the qualities
which make one acceptable <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_138'></a>138</span> down here&#8211;Wait! I&#8217;ll change that. In
the qualities which would make one acceptable to me you are lacking to a very
considerable degree. And it is just there that you fill me with the greatest
doubt&#8211;doubt so grave, indeed, that I cannot&#8211;and I use the verb
advisedly&#8211;cannot permit myself to like you in the way you want me to like
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again he bestirred himself. &#8220;What is that, please? What is that
quality?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have tried to tell you,&#8221; she rejoined, patiently. &#8220;It is
a really worth-while ambition. You lack the desire to do something, the desire
to be something&#8211;a desire that ought to have been yours, should have been
yours, years ago&#8211;the thing part and parcel of our blood down here. It may
take shape in any one of a hundred different things&#8211;business ventures;
personal prospectings; pursuit of art, science; raising cattle&#8211;anything,
Stephen! But something, something which will develop a real value, both to
yourself and to your fellow-man. We have it. We have inherited it. We got it
from our grandfathers&#8211;our great-grandfathers, in a few cases&#8211;men who
wanted to know&#8211;to learn&#8211;to learn by doing. It is a powerful force.
It must be a powerful force, it must have been strong within them, for it
dragged them out of the comforts of civilization and led them into the desert.
But they found what they sought; and in finding what they sought they found
themselves also. And what they found&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>&#8220;Was
something which, having drawn them forward to the frontier, filled them with
dislike for those who remained behind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you wish to put it that way&#8211;yes.&#8221; Her answer was
straight and clean-cut.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what of those who remained behind?&#8221; asked Stephen, alert
now. &#8220;Surely the quality was there! It must be there yet! Those of the
old-timers who remained behind must have stayed simply because of circumstances.
Good men often curb the adventurous spirit out of sheer conscientious regard for
others who&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is you, Stephen!&#8221; interrupted Helen, quietly. &#8220;It is
you, yourself. All Easterners are not like you, I well know. Yet you and your
type are found in all parts of the East.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stephen stood for a long moment, his eyes fixed on the mystic skyline. Then
he turned to her as if about to speak. But there was only the silent message of
his longing eyes. Finally he turned away and, as if unconsciously, fell to
stroking the horse.</p>

<p>He had nothing to say, and he knew it. The girl was right, and he knew that.
She had pointed out to him only what others at different times had mildly tried
to make him see. He was a rich young man, or would be after a death or two in
his family. But that in itself was no excuse for his inertia. Many had told him
that. But he had never taken it seriously. It had remained for the little woman
beside him to make him fully realize it. She alone had driven it home so that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span> it hurt. Yet
between this girl and the others who had taken him mildly to task there was the
difference between day and darkness. For he loved this girl, and if she would
not marry him for reasons which he knew he could remedy, then it was up to him
to accept her criticism, which was perhaps a challenge, and go forth and do
something and be something, and reveal his love to her through that effort. What
it would be he did not know. He did know he must get out of the town&#8211;get
out of the Territory, if needs be&#8211;but he must go somewhere in this country
of worthy aspiration and live as he knew she would have him live, do something,
be something, something that for its very worth to her as well as to all mankind
would awaken her ready response. Such a move he realized, as he stood beside
her, would be as decent in him as she in her criticism had been eloquently
truthful. The vigor, the relentless certainty, with which she had pointed out
his weakness&#8211;no one before had had the courage to deal with him like this.
And reviewing it all, and then casting grimly forward into his future, he
suddenly awoke, as he gently stroked this mettled horse, to a strange likeness
between the spirit of horse and mistress. He turned to Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very much alike,&#8221; he declared&#8211;&#8220;you and your
horse.&#8221; Then he paused as if in thought. &#8220;The spirit of the
desert,&#8221; he went on, absently, &#8220;shows itself through all the phases
of its life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen brightened &#8220;I am glad you think that of us, Stephen,&#8221; she
answered, as if relieved by <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_141'></a>141</span> this unexpected turn. &#8220;Pat is truly of the
desert. He was born and bred in this land of <i>amole</i> and cactus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I also,&#8221; she replied, gravely. &#8220;I too was born and bred in
this land of <i>amole</i> and cactus.&#8221; Suddenly she turned her head.
&#8220;I am afraid they are looking for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>They returned to the house. Helen&#8217;s guests were preparing to depart.
There was much high humor, and when the last but one was gone, and this one,
Stephen, standing on the porch with hat in hand, Helen found that for the moment
she had forgotten her distress. At sight of him, however, it all returned to
her, and she faced him with earnest solicitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, Stephen,&#8221; she burst out, &#8220;that you forgive me my
unkind words, and that you will try to forget them. But whether you succeed in
that or not, Stephen,&#8221; she hastily added, her voice breaking, &#8220;tell
me that you will continue to be friendly. We want you, all of us&#8211;I want
you! I have enjoyed our rides together so much! They have meant much to me, and
I hope they have been enjoyable to you. So let us go on, on this accepted basis,
and be friends. Tell me you will, Stephen!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was silent a long time. Then he told her of his hastily made plans. He was
going away from town, of course. He could not remain, under the circumstances.
Yet where he was going he didn&#8217;t know. He would go farther West,
probably&#8211;go <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
somewhere and try to make good&#8211;try to do something worth while, to be
something worth while. Saying which, he then thanked her fervently for
everything&#8211;for her society, for her frank criticism, for having awakened
him to an understanding of himself.</p>

<p>Helen stood speechless. She had not anticipated this, that he would go away,
that he would leave her. A deep-surging bitterness gripped her, and for a moment
she almost relented. But only for a moment. The spell passed, and she looked at
him with frank, level eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to hear that, Stephen,&#8221; she declared, quietly.
&#8220;We want you with us&#8211;all of us. But&#8211;but tell me,&#8221; she
concluded, finding the words coming with difficulty&#8211;&#8220;tell me that
you feel no&#8211;no antagonism toward me, Stephen, because I
can&#8217;t&#8211;can&#8217;t love you as you want me to love you, and that you
understand that&#8211;that in deciding as I have I&#8211;I only wanted to be
true&#8211;true to both of us!&#8221;</p>

<p>For answer he seized both her hands in his. He gazed straight down into her
eyes. &#8220;I love you, Helen,&#8221; he murmured, and then slowly released her
fingers.</p>

<p>He left her so quietly that she hardly knew that he was gone. A step on the
trail aroused her, and, lifting her eyes, she saw him striding away with
shoulders back and head erect, as if awakened to a new manhood. And watching him
go, as she felt, for the last time, she could no more control a sob than he at
the moment could turn <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_143'></a>143</span> back. For a while she followed him with wistful
eyes, then, finding sudden need for consolation, she hurried off the porch and
across to the corral. Pat was there to receive her, and she flung her arms
around his neck and gave way to sudden tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pat,&#8221; she sobbed, &#8220;I&#8211;perhaps I do love him! Perhaps
I have done wrong! I&#8211;I&#8211;&#8221; She interrupted herself. &#8220;What
shall I do, Pat?&#8221; she burst out, bitterly. &#8220;Oh, what shall I
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>Pat could not advise her. But he remained very still, supporting her weight
with dumb patience, until she turned away, going slowly back into the house.
Then he pressed close into his corner and sounded a shrill, protracted
nicker.</p>

<p>That was all.</p>

<p>He saw the door close. He waited, pursuing his old habit, for all the lights
to go out. And directly they began to disappear, one by one, first in the lower
half of the house, then in the upper half, until all save one were extinguished.
This one, as he knew from long experience, was in the room of his mistress. But
though he waited and watched till the moon slanted behind the western hills, and
the stars to the east dimmed and faded, and the gray of dawn stole across the
sky above the mountains&#8211;though he waited and watched till his legs ached
from long standing, and his eyes smarted from their steady vigil, and the
Mexican appeared yawning from the depths of the stable, and from over toward
town rose sounds of worldly activity&#8211;yet the light in her <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span> room burned on. Then the
Mexican drove him into the stable. But not even now did he abandon his vigil. He
entered his box-stall, with its tiny square window, and fixed his troubled gaze
again upon the house. The sky was bright with coming day. From somewhere arose
the crow of a rooster. Out on the river trail a team plodded slowly to
market.</p>

<p>But the light in the room was still burning.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span><a id='link_12'></a>CHAPTER XII<br /><span class='h2fs'>ADVENTURE</span></h2>

<p>It was late afternoon when Helen came down from her room. She had regained
her calm. The Judge had gone about his affairs, her aunt was deep in her siesta,
the Mexican woman was bustling about in the kitchen. Refusing this kindly
soul&#8217;s offer of food, she walked listlessly into the library and sank into
a huge chair. Spring was well advanced, yet there was an open fire. Elbows upon
the arms of her chair, hands clasped under her chin, she turned unseeing eyes
upon the flickering flames. Motionless, barely breathing, she was a picture of
hopeless grief.</p>

<p>Yet her thoughts were active. One after another the swift-moving events of
the night before came to her&#8211;a night of delightful happenings and
torturing surprises. She recalled that the crowd had been unusually gay, but
that Stephen had been unusually quiet and absorbed. She remembered the games,
and the story-telling, and the toasting of marshmallows in the grate. But over
against these simple pleasures there had been Stephen, entering into the gaiety
only because he must, now forcing a smile, now drawing back <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span> within himself, until a chorus of
laughter would again force him to smile. Yet she had understood, and she had
excused him. She had thought him resigned and content to be merely one of the
crowd. And then had come that opportunity which evidently he had sought. It had
come as a surprise. But with it had come also a sudden desire to be alone with
him, and to impress upon him her convictions. So they had gone out into the
moonlight, to the corral fence, and to Pat, where she had endeavored to make
everything clear. And then their return, and the departure of her guests, and
his lingering on the porch, and his decision to go away, to leave her for ever.
He hadn&#8217;t put it in just that way! But that was what he was
doing&#8211;that was what he had done. He had gone from her for ever.</p>

<p>The thought hurt. It hurt because she knew what part she had taken in it. She
knew that she herself had sent him away. And when he had left her she knew, as
she knew now, that in her heart she did not want it. For she liked
him&#8211;liked his society. She liked his care-free manner, his whimsical
outlook upon her country, his many natural talents&#8211;his playing, and the
naïveté of his singing, while he often admitted that his voice hurt him, and so
must hurt others. No, she had not wanted him to go away. And somehow it had
never occurred to her that he would go for ever. But he was gone, and she could
not resign herself. Yet there was no calling him back. She had made a decision,
had forced him to understand certain <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_147'></a>147</span> things. So she must accept it. But it hurt. It was
slowly dawning upon her that she would never forget him.</p>

<p>Then another thought came to her. Since he was going, and since she had sent
him away, it occurred to her that she ought to help him. It seemed to be her
duty. Yet she could not determine how. He was going forth to prove himself. He
would go where men only could go, and she was but a woman. And she wanted him to
prove himself&#8211;she knew that&#8211;knew it more with every moment that
passed. She believed he had it in him. Yet she might help in some way. She
wanted to be of some use to him in his undertaking. What could she do?</p>

<p>Suddenly, as she sat there, seemingly powerless, there came a shrill nicker
whipping across from the corral&#8211;the voice of Pat.</p>

<p>Like a flash she had it! Stephen would go into the cattle country&#8211;she
believed that. And in the cattle country he would need a horse, a good horse,
such a horse as Pat. She would present the horse to Stephen! She would send Pat
with him because she herself could not go with him. This she could do. Thus she
would help Stephen to find himself, as her ancestors had found themselves. She
would help him to become what she wanted him to become&#8211;a man&#8211;a
<i>man</i>! Yes, she would give Pat to Stephen. She would send the horse as she
had sent the man&#8211;forth into the world of deeds&#8211;deeds denied her
sex.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>She rose
hurriedly and ascended to her room. At her desk she drew paper and pen toward
her.</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>My dear Stephen [she began her letter],&#8211;I am sending Pat to you through
Miguel. I wanted to help you in some way. I cannot help you myself directly, but
in Pat I feel you will have a valuable aid. Take him&#8211;take him with my
dearest and best wishes for your success. Pat may actually show you the
way&#8211;may actually point the way out to you. Who knows? He understands who
you are, I know, and I am sure he knows what you have been, and what you still
are, to me.</p> </div><!-- block quote -->

<p class='tar sc'>Helen.</p>

<p>For a moment she sat deep in thought. Then suddenly awaking to the lateness
of the hour, she arose and, going to the corral, called to the hostler. Miguel
appeared, and she handed him the note, giving him careful instructions the while
in regard to the horse. The Mexican smiled and entered the stable in quest of
saddle and bridle, the while she turned to Pat in his corner and explained what
she was about to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pat dear,&#8221; she began, nestling her cheek against his head,
&#8220;you are going away. You are going with Stephen. Do you remember
Stephen?&#8221; Emotion began to grip her. &#8220;You have served me well, Pat,
and faithfully. I hope you will prove as true to your new master. I&#8211;I
wanted to help him. But I&#8211;I
couldn&#8217;t&#8211;couldn&#8217;t&#8211;&#8221; She could not go on. Gazing up
into his eyes she seemed to see him waver&#8211;knew that it was because of her
blinding tears&#8211;and abruptly left him and returned to the house.</p>

<p>In her room she stood weeping at the window <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_149'></a>149</span> overlooking the corral. She saw the Mexican bridle
and saddle her pride, saw him carefully tuck away her note, and saw him mount
Pat with a great show of importance, as though elated with his commission. Then
she saw him ride Pat out of the corral, across into the river trail, and turn
toward town. Seeing her horse go from her, perhaps for all time, she turned from
the window and flung herself across her bed, where she gave way to her grief.
Her Pat was gone! Her Pat&#8211;heart of her life&#8211;was gone!</p>

<p>Miguel was indeed pleased with his commission. Never before had he been
astride this so-wonderful horse. As he rode along, testing the ease of
Pat&#8217;s gait, noting with what readiness he responded to the reins, he fell
to wishing that it were not so near dusk, since then he might become the object
of envious eyes in town. But he could not control the hour of day, even though
he could control the horse&#8217;s movements. So he cantered along until he
reached the town proper, when he slowed Pat into a walk. Lights were being
switched on along the avenue, and in their glare he enjoyed to the full whatever
admiring glances were turned his way from the sidewalks. But as he neared the
hotel where Stephen was stopping he urged Pat into a canter first, then into a
gallop, pulling up before the side entrance with a quick reining that brought
both the horse and himself to a stop with a magnificent flourish. It was
good&#8211;as he admitted to himself. Then he slipped to earth. And now his
magnificence <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span> left
him, for he never before had entered this so-beautiful hostelry. Girting in his
belt, however, he strode up the steps, faltered on the threshold, and was
directed to the clerk. This magnate handed the letter to a bell-boy.</p>

<p>Stephen was seated in his room when he read Helen&#8217;s note. When he
raised his eyes he stared unseeingly at the light across the street, deep in
thought.</p>

<p>He knew what this had cost Helen. Riding with her almost every day for
months, he could not but understand the depth of her attachment for the horse.
Pat for years had been the one big factor in her life. And now she was giving
Pat to him, to help him prove himself. It was a great thing to do, so great that
he must accept it, and already, at this proof of her interest, he somehow felt
assured of success. Also he saw a way open. He would go down into the cattle
country, make a connection with some cattle interests, and, with Pat as guide
and friend and capable servant, work out his destiny. Exactly what that would be
he did not know. But he did know that he was going after it.</p>

<p>He turned to the boy still standing in the doorway. &#8220;Tell the man that
I&#8217;ll be down directly,&#8221; he said. Then he made his way into his
mother&#8217;s suite of rooms.</p>

<p>The frail little woman showed surprise at his decision. But she said nothing.
She nodded quiet acquiescence and went on with her instructions to her maid, who
was laying clothing away <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_151'></a>151</span> in preparation for the return East in the morning.
Evidently she knew her boy. Whereupon Stephen, after explaining further, though
no more fully than before, left her, descending to the office.</p>

<p>Miguel was standing awkwardly near the doorway, and with Stephen&#8217;s
appearance touched his hat and led the way outside. Pat was facing three boys,
the center of their interest, but when Stephen approached him, and talked to
him, he turned and responded with a soft whinny, seeming to understand. Miguel
remained at a respectful distance, awaiting orders. Then telling him to wait for
a note to be taken to Miss Richards, Stephen re-entered the hotel.</p>

<p>The boys swirled off in play. Miguel stood alone with the horse. There were
but few persons on the streets, since it was early evening and people were at
supper. Miguel&#8217;s wandering eyes at length rested upon the swing-doors of a
saloon opposite&#8211;rested there a long time. Finally, unable longer to resist
their spell, he glanced at Pat&#8217;s bridle, noted that the reins were
securely tied, and then yielded to the attention of the saloon. In a moment the
swing-doors closed upon him.</p>

<p>They had barely ceased swinging when out of a doorway just down the street
stole the figure of a man. He was young, smooth of face, garbed in blue shirt
and overalls, with eyes well concealed under a black sombrero low-drawn. He
moved out of the shadow cautiously, with many furtive <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span> glances about him. Then he swiftly
crossed the street, hurried along the sidewalk to Pat, and reached the
horse&#8217;s head and bridle. Untying the reins from the post, he leaped into
the saddle. Then he swung Pat around, put light spurs to him, and urged him
rapidly across the avenue. Beyond the avenue toward the north lay Stygian
darkness. In these black depths he disappeared.</p>

<p>At this moment the clerk in the hotel was aroused by the unusual spectacle of
one of his guests&#8211;young Wainwright&#8211;leaping down the stairs. He
looked up with a surprised question. But Stephen ran past him, across the
office, without heed. He gained the door, rushed down the steps, and shouted.
The boys ceased playing, a passer-by came to a stop, out of the saloon opposite
stepped Miguel. Miguel hastened across, drawing his hand over his mouth as he
ran. Stephen opened upon him breathlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone!&#8221; he burst out. &#8220;I saw it from my window.
A young man in blue shirt and overalls. The horse has been stolen!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miguel threw up both hands in despair. &#8220;<i>Valgame Dios!</i>&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;I am lose my job!&#8221; He looked about him blankly.</p>

<p>Sick at heart, not knowing what to do, Stephen himself bolted back into the
hotel. He entered the telephone booth and rang up the Judge&#8217;s office. It
was late, but he took a chance. The Judge answered the call. His voice was weary
with the strain of a long day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who in thunder wants me at this hour?&#8221; he <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span> drawled, not unpleasantly.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t you let a man&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>Stephen interrupted with an apology. Then he told the Judge of the loss. The
Judge&#8217;s voice changed instantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine business!&#8221; he snapped. &#8220;But I reckon I know who to
look for. There&#8217;s only one man&#8211;one gang&#8211;in the Territory that
would do that in that way. It&#8217;s a job for the range police.&#8221; Then
his voice softened. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Stephen!&#8221; he added.
&#8220;You just sit tight. I&#8217;ll take it up with the
authorities.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stephen left the booth and entered the writing-room. Here he added a sad
postscript to his note to Helen. Then he went outside, despatched Miguel with
the letter, returned to his room and sat down, disconsolate and angry.</p>

<p>To have Pat sent to him with this noble generosity, and then to lose him!
Surely fate was more than unkind. The horse, given into his keeping, had been
wrested from him at once. Yes, he was all that Helen had intimated that he
was&#8211;a man incapable of trust, a man such as she could never permit
herself&#8211;and he recalled her words now with rankling bitterness&#8211;to
care for in the way he wanted her to care for him. Knowing that Pat was gone
from him, and gone in such ignoble fashion, he knew that he never could face the
horse&#8217;s mistress again. This was bitterest of all! For a time he gave way
to despair.</p>

<p>Presently he awoke to a sense of stern responsibility. <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span> The horse had been delivered. Miguel
had safely delivered him. It was all up to him then, Stephen, and to nobody
else. He alone was responsible, and it was his duty to get Pat back. Out of his
self-doubting this realization came with a sense of comfort. His course now lay
clearly before him. He would get the horse back! He <i>must</i> get him back!
There was nothing else left for him. For if he ever expected to return to Helen,
and this was his life&#8217;s hope, he must return to her with the horse. He
could return to her in no other way.</p>

<p>He saw the difficulties. This was a large country, and he knew but very
little of its activities. He recalled what the Judge had intimated&#8211;that
the character of the thieves was such as to offer no encouragement of successful
pursuit to any but men schooled to the country and the habits of the thieves.
Yet against this and in his favor was the widespread reputation of Pat, and that
certainly ought to be of some help in his pursuit. But, difficult or
easy&#8211;take a month or a year&#8211;take five years&#8211;he would get Pat
and return him to his mistress! The Judge had spoken of range police. Why
couldn&#8217;t he enlist with these men, enlist in any capacity, and accompany
them till such time as he should learn the country well enough to venture out
alone if necessary in his quest? At any rate, he would have a talk with the
Judge&#8211;would see him early in the morning. He arose to his feet. The thing
was settled in his mind. Also for the first time in his life his view <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span> had an object. He would
go forth into life, get that which it withheld from him, bring it back and place
it before the woman of his choice.</p>

<p>And now, so great is the power, so prompt the reward, of energy rightly
applied, he found himself whistling as he began to toss wearing-apparel into a
traveling-bag.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span><a id='link_13'></a>CHAPTER XIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>IN THE WASTE PLACES</span></h2>

<p>Pat well knew that this new experience was a strange thing. The trip with the
hostler, the unusual hour of day, the appearance of his mistress&#8217;s friend,
the stranger out of the night, the hurried departure from the hotel, all told
him that. But whether it was right or wrong, he did not know. His mistress had
quite sanctioned his leaving the corral, and so all things developing out of
that must have her sanction also&#8211;thus worked his instincts. So not once
had he rebelled. Nor was he rebelling now. And yet&#8211;and this was his
emotional conflict&#8211;within him was a vague feeling that he should rebel,
should kick, buck, toss, and pitch, and throw off this stranger. It grew upon
him, this feeling, until, in a section of town unfamiliar to him, he decided to
give way to it, to take a chance, anyway, of unseating this man and dashing back
into that part of town familiar to him. But he did not. Suddenly a soothing
voice restrained, the voice of his rider, which swept away for a time all
thought of rebellion.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re Pat!&#8221; the man said, and, though his <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span> voice was gentle, and
perhaps kindly, as Pat judged the human voice, he yet somehow did not like the
owner of it. &#8220;Well, they hain&#8217;t lied to me, anyway,&#8221; went on
the voice. &#8220;You&#8217;re one nice piece of horseflesh!&#8221;</p>

<p>That was all. But somehow it dispelled all discontent within Pat. Thereafter
he thought only of his task, which was that of holding to a devious course
through winding alleys and streets well under rein, until he found himself on
the river trail and heading south through a section not unfamiliar to him. Then
his interest only quickened.</p>

<p>As he went on, it came to him that he rather liked this traveling through the
gloom of night. It was a new experience for him, and the trail, familiar to him,
yet somehow not familiar, offered much of interest. Ranch-houses, clumps of
trees, soft-rustling fields of alfalfa, looming up before or beside him, taxed
his powers of recognition as the stars in the heavens, becoming ever more
overcast, withdrew, and with them the moon, leaving the earth and its objects
finally mere tragic outlines. These objects, rising silently before him, gave
him many fitful starts, and seemed to forbid this night-incursion. But he held
to the trail, for the most part in perfect contentment, enjoying his unwonted
call to duty, but wondering whither it was leading him.</p>

<p>This contentment did not last. It broke as he found himself rounding a bend
which he recognized as leading to the river bridge. The change <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span> came not through the
flicking of his conscience like his former feeling, but through sudden awakening
to physical discomfort. For a time he did not know what it was&#8211;though he
had questioned the new grip on the reins, the rider&#8217;s seat, his weight.
There it was. The man&#8217;s weight. Miguel had been heavy, of course, but
Miguel&#8217;s seat had been short-lived. This man must weigh fully as much as
Miguel, and twice as much as his mistress, and he had been on his back now a
long time. There came another something. As Pat grew aware of the weight it
seemed to become heavier, so he decided to seek relief of some sort. He dropped
back into a walk, grimly taking his comfort into his own control. And, half
expecting that the man would force him into a canter again, he continued at a
walk. But neither by word nor movement did the man show that he noticed the
change. So Pat settled to his task again, once more enjoying quiet
satisfaction.</p>

<p>But neither did this last. He soon found another cause for dissatisfaction.
He found it because, unconsciously, he was looking for it. He found it this time
in the tight grip on his reins, which was setting up a sore chafing in the
corners of his mouth. His mistress had never held him so tightly. The result of
it, together with his other discomfort, was that he became sullen and
antagonistic, and, descending the slight grade to the bridge, he determined to
resist. And resist he did. He came to a sudden stop, threw down his head,
pitched and bucked frantically. His <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_159'></a>159</span> efforts carried him all over the trail, and once
dangerously near the edge and the turbulent waters below. But he found himself
unable to throw off the weight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess maybe&#8211;I made&#8211;a slight&#8211;mistake!&#8221; exploded
the rider, clamping his knees against Pat. &#8220;But go&#8211;go to
it&#8211;old trader!&#8221;</p>

<p>Pat accepted the challenge. For this he knew it was. He leaped and twisted;
returned to earth with a jolt; pitched and tossed and bucked. And he kept it up,
fighting grimly, till he discovered its futility, when he stopped. A moment he
stood, breathing heavily, then he set out across the bridge, whisking his tail
and wriggling his ears, all in spirited acceptance of reluctant defeat.</p>

<p>He did not attempt further rebellion. Slow-kindling respect stirred within
him for this man upon his back&#8211;the respect but not love which one
entertains toward the mighty, and he gained the end of the bridge and turned
south along the trail, partly reconciled. Yet he had not rebelled in vain. The
grip on his bit no longer annoyed him, and though the weight still remained
heavy, somehow it seemed more endurable now through some cause which he could
not determine&#8211;probably his increased respect for it. So he trotted along,
amiably disposed toward all the world, pleasantly anticipatory of the immediate
future, ears and eyes alert and straining toward all things. On his left the
river gurgled softly in the desert stillness&#8211;a stillness sharply broken.
From afar off came a strange call, the long-drawn howl of a coyote. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span> It was not alone.
Instantly from a point dead ahead rose another, grooving into the echo of the
first in a staccato yelp. Then the first opened up with a choking whine that
lifted steadily into an ecstatic mating-call, and Pat saw a black something,
blacker even than the night, leap against the far, faint skyline, dangle
seemingly a trembling moment, then flash from view across the desert.</p>

<p>Which was but one of the many incidents that served to hold his interest and
increase his alertness as he fox-trotted along the road. Nor was one of them
without its informing value. For this was his first night journey, and what he
saw now would remain with him vividly, helping him to become as successful on
night trails as he was now by day.</p>

<p>Something else came to him out of the darkness. It was off to his distant
right and well back from the river. It was a tiny gleam of light, shining out of
the density of the desert. He watched it with studied interest. It glowed like a
cat&#8217;s eye, and, fascinated, quietly speculative, he kept his eyes upon it
until, as he turned a bend in the trail, he saw another light flash into view
close beside the first, and equal to it in brilliancy. Suddenly, watching these
lights, his interest leaped higher. This was his destination. He instinctively
knew it. And presently he was certain of it, for his master, urging him to the
right, now sent him along a narrow path that led straight toward the lights.</p>

<p>Within a very few moments Pat found himself <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_161'></a>161</span> before a hulk of an adobe. It was a long, rambling
structure, somehow forbidding, and he blinked as he stared with faint
apprehension at the lamplight streaming out of two windows. Directly the man
dismounted and, making the reins fast to a post, walked toward the house. For a
moment Pat saw his tall figure silhouetted in the doorway, to the accompaniment
of a quiet chorus of greetings from within, then he saw the door close upon him,
and immediately afterward a hand appear at the windows and draw down the shades.
And now he felt a great loneliness creep over him, slowly at first, then somehow
faster as he heard voices within sink from a cheerful note of greeting to a low
rumble of discord.</p>

<p>He began to take heed of objects close around him. He discovered, now that
all light was shut off, that he was not alone. To his left stood two horses,
with heads drooping, legs slightly spread, reins dangling, quiet and patient in
their mute waiting. Promptly with the discovery he took a step in their
direction, intent upon establishing friendship. But he found himself checked
with a jerk. For an instant he did not understand this. Then he remembered that
his reins were tied, and because his mistress never had deemed this necessary he
came to feel a kind of irritation, though he made no attempt to force his
freedom. Yet, keeping his eyes upon the other horses, he saw that they
themselves were free to come and go, that their reins were dangling on the
ground. And now he realized that he was under suspicion. <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span> He knew what that was from long
association with the Mexican hostler, and, smarting under it, he determined to
show his new master, and that before many hours had elapsed, he as well as these
others was capable of trust.</p>

<p>The door flung open and three men filed out. A fourth remained standing on
the threshold, holding up a smoking lamp. Other than the tread of heels no sound
accompanied their appearance, no comment, no laughter, no farewells. This made a
deep impression upon him, and with further misgivings he watched the men descend
the few loose steps and make for the horses, his own master, the tallest of the
men, coming slowly toward him. A moment of gathering reins, then all mounted,
and one, a squat, powerfully built man, evidently the leader, turned in a
southwesterly direction, riding off in the engulfing darkness, heading away from
the river. Seeing this, Pat stepped out after him, pressing close upon the heels
of his horse, conscious that the third horse, ridden by a little man, was
crowding him for second position. But he held stubbornly to his place, and in
this place set out along an unmarked trail. He covered mile after mile at a
fox-trot, mile after mile in absolute silence, until faint rays of dawn,
streaking the sky above a ridge to the east, surprised him into realization of
the quick passage of night and his own prolonged duty therein. It was all very
strange.</p>

<p>Daylight followed swiftly. From a dull lead color the sky immediately above
the ridge, which <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
stretched away interminably north and south, gave way to a pink indescribably
rich and delicate. Steadily this pink crept over the heavens, rolling up like
the gradual unfolding of a giant canvas, dragging along in its wake hues verging
toward golden yellow, until the whole eastern sky, aflame with the light of
approaching day, was a conflagration of pinks and yellows in all their manifold
mixtures, promising, but not yet realizing, a warmth which would dispel the
spring chill left by the long night. Then, with the whole east blazing with
molten gold, there came the feeling of actual warmth, and with it the full
radiance of day&#8211;bringing out in minute detail rock and arroyo and verdant
growth, and an expanse of desert unbroken by the least vestige of animal life.
At this absence of all that which would suggest the presence of
life&#8211;adobes, corrals, windmills&#8211;Pat awoke again to vague uneasiness
and fell to pondering his future under these men, whom he now instinctively knew
pursued ways outside the bounds of the civilization of his past.</p>

<p>A voice behind, presumably that of the little man, interrupted the protracted
silence. It was high-pitched.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that hoss a-holdin&#8217;, Jim?&#8221;</p>

<p>Pat felt a slight twitch on the reins. Evidently the man had been in deep
thought, out of which the voice had startled him. Directly he made answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got quality here, Glover&#8211;I guess. Can&#8217;t never tell,
though. He&#8217;s a good horse, but he mayn&#8217;t pan out good for
me.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>There was
further silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Johnson,&#8221; went on the high-pitched voice again, after a time,
&#8220;did ye git what Zeke said about the country down there?&#8221;</p>

<p>But the leader seemed not to hear. Straight as an arrow, bulking large upon a
little gray mare, he moved not the fraction of an inch with the question.
Whereupon the little man, after muttering something further about Zeke, relapsed
into silence.</p>

<p>Suddenly Pat stumbled and fell to his knees. He quickly regained his feet,
however, and resumed the steady forward grind. And grind it now was becoming.
His legs burned with a strange distress, his eyes ached from loss of sleep.
Throughout his body was a weariness new to him. He was not accustomed to this
ceaseless fox-trotting. He could not recall the time when, even on their longest
excursion, his mistress had forced him like this. She had always considered him
to the extent of granting him many blissful periods of rest. He found himself
wanting some such consideration now. He felt that he would like to drop into a
walk or to burst into a canter, knowing the relief to be found in any change of
gait. But this was denied him. Yet, since the other horses gave no sign of
weariness, each appearing possessed of endurance greater than his own, he
refrained, through a pride greater even than his distress, from making of his
own accord any change in his gait.</p>

<p>Toward noon, as he was brooding over another distress, one caused by gnawing
hunger, he felt <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
his master draw down. Also, the others came to a stop. With the men dismounted,
he swept eyes over the scene. But he saw nothing that appeared to warrant pause.
The place was dead and desolate, barren of all that which had invariably met his
gaze when pausing with his mistress. But when one of the men began to build a
fire, while the others flung off light saddle-bags from the little gray and the
sorrel&#8211;an exceptionally rangy horse&#8211;he came in a way to understand.
Further, with the fire crackling pleasantly and his bridle and saddle removed,
he understood fully the cause of this halt. It was time to feed; and, raging
with hunger, he forgot all other distress in the thought that now he would have
a generous quantity of food, which he believed was due him, since he had more
than earned it in his prolonged service through the night. Indeed, so certain
was he of reward, he prepared himself for sugar and quartered apples, and, with
mouth dripping saliva, stood very still, eyes following every move of his new
master.</p>

<p>But he was doomed to bitter disappointment. Instead of sugar and quartered
apples, his master tied a rope around his neck and, with a friendly slap, left
him to his own devices. Wondering at this, he gazed about him&#8211;saw that the
other horses were grazing. Disappointed, fretful, stung into action by hunger
pangs, he set out in their direction, curious to learn what it was they were
feeding upon so eagerly. But, as had happened the night before, he found himself
checked with a jerk. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_166'></a>166</span> He did not like it, for it made him conscious again
of his master&#8217;s suspicions. So he turned a sour gaze upon his unrestricted
companions until, forced to it by inner yearnings amounting to acuteness now, he
himself lowered his head and fell to grazing.</p>

<p>But he found it all too insufficient. His stomach urgently demanded grain and
alfalfa. And he yearned for a little bran-mash. But there were none of these. He
saw not even a tiny morsel of flower to appease his inner grumblings, and
finally, lifting his head in a kind of disgust, he ceased to graze altogether.
As he did so, the men made ready to resume the journey, replacing bridles and
saddles and saddle-bags. Pat found himself hopeful again, believing that with
the end of this prolonged service, which in view of the distance already
traversed must be soon, he would have those things for which his body and soul
cried out. And thus he set forth, occupying his former place in the order of
advance, moving, as before, at a fox-trot and amid silence from the men. He was
still hopeful of better things to come. But it was all a drear experience.</p>

<p>The grind began to tell upon him. As he trotted along, thirst-stricken,
miserably nourished, weary from loss of sleep and this ceaseless toil, he sought
frankly for cause to rebel, as he had done in the first hour of this strange
call to new duty. And he found it. He found it not only in the man&#8217;s
weight, and the infrequent contact of spurs, and the tight grip on the reins,
all as on that first occasion, but he found it as well in other things&#8211;in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span> the dust thrown up
by the little gray ahead, in the sun&#8217;s rays slanting into his eyes from
the west, in the scorching, blistering heat of this same ruthless orb beating
down upon his back. Suddenly, cost him what it would, he dropped out of the
fox-trot into a walk, prepared to fight for this change of stride to the last
breath.</p>

<p>He did not hold to it, however, even though his master, curiously enough,
permitted him the change. Pride asserted itself, and after a time, of his own
volition, finding the gap between himself and the others much too wide to please
him, he broke into a canter and quickly closed the gap, crowding back into his
place between the other two horses. That was all of rebellion, though the mood
still remained. Bitter, disappointed, nervous, and irritable, he continued
forward, wanting things&#8211;wanting food and water, wanting sounds of voices,
wanting a respite from this unnerving grind. But he made no effort to get them
or to show that he wanted them. And he knew why he maintained this attitude of
meek acceptance. He was too weak to enforce his demands. He knew that it
required energy to buck and pitch, and he knew that he lacked this energy. So he
continued along in sullen resignation until, accepting the hint of his
instincts, he closed his eyes. This brought relief, and after a time, his
movements becoming ever more mechanical, he found himself adrift upon a peaceful
sea of semi-coma, oblivious to all trouble&#8211;hunger pangs, thirst,
weariness. When he returned to full consciousness, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span> somewhat refreshed and fit for farther
distances, he found the sun well down the western sky, the cool of evening
wrapping him about in delightful zephyrs, and he was still keeping his place
between the two horses.</p>

<p>Dusk found him in a small oasis. His master slipped to earth, and with relief
Pat gazed about him. He saw a clump of trees, and in their depths, glinting out
at him between the trunks, a shimmering pool of water. Also, near these trees,
on the edge of the grove, he saw a shack made up of rough logs. But he was
interested only in the pool, and, when his master removed his saddle, eagerly
and with a soft nicker he stepped toward it. But the man jerked him back. So he
waited, realizing that he had been hasty, till his bridle was removed, when
again he stepped toward the pool. But again he was jerked back, this time by a
firm grip on his forelock. So again he waited while the man placed the
disagreeable rope around his neck. With this secure, he found himself led into
the grove, where he soon was quenching his raging thirst, and where, after
drinking, he felt more kindly not only toward the man, but toward the whole
world. When he was conducted back into the open, and the end of the rope made
fast to a stake, he lifted his voice in a shrill nicker proclaiming his
satisfaction. Then he stood very still, watching the man enter the shack,
utterly absorbed in getting that long-delayed reward of sugar and quartered
apples.</p>

<p>But again he waited in vain. The man did not <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_169'></a>169</span> reappear; indeed, none of the men reappeared. So
after a time, swallowing his disappointment, he turned his eyes upon the other
horses. As at noon, they were grazing industriously, and he knew what was in
store for him. He regarded them a long moment, trying to bring himself to graze
also, but finding that his knowledge of better things would not permit him. Yet
there was one pleasant surprise. The little gray, sounding a soft whinny, made
her way slowly toward him. This was unexpected friendliness, for the horse had
seemed hostile earlier, and he promptly showed his pleasure by licking her neck
with lavish attention. And though he found her coat gritty with dust, he
continued this generous attention till she lowered her head and resumed her
grazing. This reminded him of his own fierce hunger, and he promptly lowered his
own head, following her example with a kind of gratitude, and fell to grazing
with her, finding in her interest the one ray of light in all the darkness of
his distress and continued disappointment. And thus he fed, keeping with her to
the limits of his tether, until, soon after the candlelight had whisked out in
the shack, she lay down in the yielding sand with a restful sigh. Pat understood
this, but he regarded it with uncertainty, knowing that he himself with the
coming of night always had protection in a stable. Then, deciding that it was
right and fitting, especially as the sorrel also sank into the sand, he himself
bent his knees and lay down to rest in the warmth of the desert.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>But his lesson
in the open was not yet fully learned. Next morning, with the other horses
astir, and with the men moving in and out of the shack, he saw his master coming
toward him. Reaching him, the man untied the rope from the stake, led him to the
pool of water, and permitted him to drink. Then he returned him to the open, and
there removed the rope from him entirely. But despite this he found that he was
not free from suspicion. For now the man tied a short rope around his fore
ankles, and strode back into the shack, leaving him, as before, to his own
devices.</p>

<p>Half expecting the man to return with sugar and apples, Pat watched him take
himself off with mild anticipation. But as the man did not return he bethought
him after a time of his sterner hunger, and took prompt step in the direction of
a tuft of grass. Instantly he felt a sharp twitch at his ankles and fell
headlong. For a moment he lay dazed, utterly at a loss to understand, thrashing
about frantically in futile effort to regain his feet. Then he became calm
again, and brought craftiness instead of brute force to bear upon the trouble.
He regained his feet. Then he studied the cause of the disaster, and finally
stepped out again, cautiously now, having learned his lesson. So he did not
stumble. But he did feel the check around his ankles again. Steadying himself,
he saw clearly the cause of his previous discomfiture, but he did not accept it
as defeat. Casting his eyes toward the other horses, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span> he awoke to the fact that they, as well
as himself, were hobbled. Watching them, studying them, he finally saw one rear,
strike out with his front legs, and draw his hind legs up to meet the advance.
So that was it! He now knew what he himself must do. Feeling out his hobbles
carefully, gathering quick courage the while, he himself at length reared,
struck out with fore legs, followed up with hind legs, and found himself
directly over the tuft of grass. This was pleasant, and he promptly began to
nibble it, finding it no less toothsome&#8211;perhaps more toothsome&#8211;for
the effort. And when he had finished this he gazed about for others, and, seeing
others, moved upon each in turn as he had moved upon the first, rearing and
striking, following it with hind legs, rearing and striking again, following
again with hind legs, all successfully. And so he learned his second great
lesson in the open.</p>

<p>Thus he began his life in the desert. Fraught as it was with much discomfort,
both spiritual and physical, he yet found much of interest in it all, and he was
destined to find in it, as time went on, much more of even greater interest. And
in the days which followed, and the weeks and months following these, because he
showed that he was willing and anxious to learn, to attune himself to the life,
he aroused in all who came in contact with him, men as well as horses, an esteem
and affection which made life smoother and more pleasant for him than it might
otherwise have been.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span><a id='link_14'></a>CHAPTER XIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>A PICTURE</span></h2>

<p>A hundred miles west from the shack, stretching away from it in an almost
unbroken expanse, was a desert within the desert. <i>Amole</i> and sagebrush and
cactus vied with each other to relieve the dead, flat, monotonous brown. Without
movement anywhere, save for the heat-waves ascending, this expanse presented an
unutterably drear and lonesome aspect. It terminated, or partly
terminated&#8211;swerving off into the south beyond&#8211;in a long sand-dune
running northeast and southwest. This mighty roll lay brooding, as did the
world-old expanse fringing it, in the silence of late morning. Overhead a
turquoise sky, low, spotless, likewise brooding, dipped down gracefully to the
horizon around&#8211;a horizon like an immense girdle, a girdle which, as one
journeyed along, seemed to accompany him, rapidly if he moved rapidly, slowly if
he moved slowly&#8211;an immense circle of which he was the center. The sun was
glaring, and revealed here and there out of the drifts a bleached skeleton,
mutely proclaiming the sun as overlord, while over all, around and about and
within this throbbing furnace, there seemed to lurk a voice, a voice of but a
softly lisped word&#8211;solitude.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>Suddenly, like a
mere dot against the skyline, there appeared over the giant dune to the north a
single horseman. A moment he seemed to pause on the crest, then began the long
descent, slowly, with almost imperceptible movement. He was not more than under
way when another dot appeared against the skyline, a second horseman, close
behind the first, who, like the first, after seeming to pause a moment on the
crest, dipped into the long slope with almost imperceptible movement. A third
dot appeared, two dots close beside each other, and these, like the others,
dipping into the descent with almost imperceptible movement, for all the world
like flies reluctantly entering a giant saucer. And then appeared another, the
fifth, and then no more. The last also seemed to pause a brief moment on the
crest, and also dipped with almost imperceptible movement into the long
descent.</p>

<p>They struck the floor of the furnace. Details began to emerge. One was a fat
man, another was a gaunt man, a third was a little man&#8211;all smooth of face.
Then there was a man with a scrubby beard. And there was another smooth-faced
man, riding a little apart from the others, a little more alert, perhaps, his
garments not their garments, his horse a little rounder of outline, a little
more graceful of movement. They might have been in conversation, these riders
out of the solitude. But all were heavily armed. And all rode slowly, leisurely,
taking their own good time, as if this in itself was duty, with orders
uncertain, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span> or with
no orders at all. They rode on across the desert within the desert, presenting
three-quarter profile, then, with an hour passing, full profile, then, with
another hour passing, quarter profile, and now, with yet another hour passing,
five agreeable backs&#8211;broad, most of them, all topped with sombreros, and
all motionless save for the movement of their mounts. On and on they rode into
the south, underneath a blistering sun at full zenith. They became mere dots
again upon the pulsating horizon, mere specks, and disappeared in the shimmering
haze.</p>

<p>Solitude, the voice of solitude, the death-stillness, throbbing silence,
reigned once more. Not an animal, not an insect, not a tree, struck the eye. The
arid and level floor was again clean of movement. The sun glared, revealing here
and there out of the drifts a bleached skeleton, in this speechless thing mutely
proclaiming its own sway. Beneath the sun the horizon, an immense girdle, swept
round in unbroken line, pulsating. The turquoise sky hung low, spotless and
shimmering, brooding, dipping smoothly down to the horizon and to the long
sand-dune running to northeast and southwest. Skirting this dune, reaching to it
out of the east, then swerving off to the south beyond, lay the almost unbroken
expanse, the desert within the desert, its dead, flat, monotonous brown relieved
here and there with alternating sagebrush and cactus and <i>amole</i>,
stretching back a distance of a hundred miles to the shack.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span><a id='link_15'></a>CHAPTER XV<br /><span class='h2fs'>CHANGE OF MASTERS</span></h2>

<p>The interior of the shack was comparatively bare. On the floor, which was of
adobe, and therefore hard and smooth as cement, were five three-legged stools
and a table, all crude and evidently shaped out of saplings from the grove.
There was but a single window, high up, tiny and square, containing neither
glass nor frame, which looked out upon the south. Built against the walls were
some shelves, upon which lay a scant supply of tinware, and in the opposite wall
was a tier of bunks, just now littered with soiled blankets. Evidently this
place had sheltered these men frequently, for each moved about it with easy
familiarity, and obviously it was a retreat, a rendezvous, a hiding-place
against the range police.</p>

<p>A game of cards was about to be started. The three men were seated round the
table, and before two of them&#8211;the younger man, Jim, and the heavy-set man,
the leader, Johnson&#8211;was an even distribution of chips. The third man,
Glover, was smoking a short-stemmed pipe, evidently having been cut out of the
play.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_176'></a>176</span>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; said Johnson, showing his perfect
teeth with an unpleasant grin, &#8220;we&#8217;ll hop right to this! I think my
little proposition here is fair and square. Thirty dollars in money against that
black horse out there. I told you where you could get a good horse, and you got
one sure enough! And he&#8217;s yours! But I&#8217;ve taken a kind of shine to
him myself, and why ain&#8217;t this a good way to push it over? My little gray
and thirty dollars in money. What&#8217;s the matter with it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The other did not appear greatly pleased, nevertheless. Thoughtfully he
riffled the cards a long moment. Then he looked up into Johnson&#8217;s black
eyes steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poker?&#8221; he asked, quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Draw poker,&#8221; replied the leader, giving his black mustache a
satisfied twist. He jerked his head in the direction of the chips. &#8220;Win
all, take all,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>Jim lowered his eyes again. He was not more than a boy, this outlaw, and he
had formed a strong attachment for the black horse. And because he had come to
understand Pat and to appreciate him, he hated to think of the horse&#8217;s
serving under this bloodless man opposite. Pat&#8217;s life under this man would
be a life of misery. It was so with all of Johnson&#8217;s horses. Either they
died early, or else, as in the case of the little gray, their spirits sank under
his cruelty to an ebb so low that nothing short of another horse, and one
obviously capable of rendering successful protection, roused them to an interest
in their <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span> own
welfare. This was why the little gray, he recalled, had approached the black the
first night after reaching the shack. Evidently she had recognized in him an
able protector, should he care to protect her, against the brutality of her
master. And so to play a game of cards, or anything else, with a view to losing
possession&#8211;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t hear you saying!&#8221; cut in the cold voice of the
other upon his thoughts. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t the stakes right?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jim looked up. &#8220;I guess so,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m
tryin&#8217; to figure&#8211;percentages and the like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again he relapsed into thought. He feared this man as he feared a snake. For
Johnson had a grip on him in many ways, and in ways unpleasant to recall. So he
knew that to refuse meant a volley of invectives that would end in his losing
the horse anyway, losing him by force, and a later treatment of the animal,
through sheer spite, the brutality of which he did not like to contemplate. So
he did not reply; he did not dare to say yes or no. Either way, the horse was
gone. For Johnson was clever with the cards, fiendishly clever, and when playing
recognized no law save crookedness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; burst out Johnson, controlling himself evidently with
effort, &#8220;I want to ask you something. I want you to tell me something. I
want you to tell me who it was grubstaked you that winter you needed grubstaking
mighty bad. I want you to tell me who it was got you out of that scrape over in
Lincoln County two years ago. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_178'></a>178</span> I want you to tell me who it was took care of you
last winter&#8211;under mighty trying circumstances, too&#8211;and put you in
the way of easy money this spring! But you needn&#8217;t tell me,&#8221; he
suddenly concluded, picking up the cards savagely. &#8220;I know who it was
without your telling me, and you know who it was without my telling you. And now
what&#8217;s the returns? When I give you a chance to come back a
little&#8211;in a dead-square, open game of cards&#8211;you crawl into your
shell and act like I&#8217;d asked you to step on the gallows.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jim permitted himself a quiet smile. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m
playing the hog, exactly,&#8221; he rejoined, evenly. &#8220;I guess maybe
I&#8217;m thinking of the horse as much as anything. And not so much of him,
either, maybe, as of you, the way you handle horses if they don&#8217;t dance a
two-step when you want a two-step. In about a week, Johnson,&#8221; he
continued, mildly, &#8220;you&#8217;d have that horse jabbed full of holes with
them Mexican rowels of yours! He wouldn&#8217;t stand for that kind of
affection, or I&#8217;m no judge of horseflesh. He ain&#8217;t used to it; he
ain&#8217;t that kind of a horse&#8211;your kind! You ought to see that
yourself. You don&#8217;t want no spirited horse like him, because either
you&#8217;d kill him or he&#8217;d kill you. <i>I</i> can see it, if you
can&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll now cut for deal,&#8221; interposed Johnson, grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take myself,&#8221; went on the other, half smiling &#8220;why I like
the idea of keeping him. I used to kill cats and rob nests and stone dogs when I
was <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span> a kid; but
later I learned different. I didn&#8217;t kill cats and rob nests after that;
dogs I got to petting whenever I&#8217;d meet one. I got acquainted with animals
that way. Made the acquaintance from both angles&#8211;seeing how they acted
under torture, then learning how they acted under kindness. I know animals,
Johnson,&#8221; he added, quietly. &#8220;And an animal to me is an animal and
something more. A horse, for instance. I see more in a horse than just an easy
way of getting around. But that ain&#8217;t you. You&#8217;re like a man I once
knowed that kept a dog just because the dog was a good hunter. If I
couldn&#8217;t see more in a dog than just what he&#8217;s fit for, I&#8217;d
quit the sport.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;ll cut for deal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jim had been rocking back and forth easily on two legs of his stool. He now
dropped forward squarely on the floor and nodded assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut for deal,&#8221; he said, quietly. &#8220;You!&#8221;</p>

<p>The game began. Glover, who evidently found interest in discussions, but none
whatever in a game of cards, tilted back against the wall and began to talk, now
that the argument was over.</p>

<p>&#8220;Zeke tells me,&#8221; he began in a nasal voice, tamping the tobacco
into the bowl of his pipe reflectively, &#8220;as how they&#8217;s a bunch
o&#8217; Injun renegades movin&#8217; south&#8217;ards off the reservation on a
hell-toot. I meant to speak of it afore, but forgot, as usual. Jim&#8217;s talk
here o&#8217; animals lovin&#8217; each other that away reminds me.&#8221; He
lifted gray eyes to Johnson. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t Zeke say nothin&#8217; to you
about that, neither?&#8221; he asked, evidently <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_180'></a>180</span> mindful of some other grave oversight on the part
of &#8220;Zeke.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnson did not reply until after three or four rounds of the cards.
&#8220;Zeke told you a lot of things that hour you sat with him alone,&#8221; he
rejoined, with broad sarcasm. &#8220;Zeke must like you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mebbe,&#8221; agreed Glover, accepting the remark with all
seriousness. &#8220;He says as how Fort Wingate is out, and I remarks that sich
a move about terminates the performance. He agrees with me&#8211;says fust
squint them renegades gits at regular troops they&#8217;ll hunt gopher-holes as
places o&#8217; ginerous salvation.&#8221;</p>

<p>The others remained silent. The game was going decidedly against Jim. It had
gone against him from the first&#8211;as he had known it would. Yet he continued
to play, watchful of his opponent, keen to note any irregularities. Yet he had
discovered nothing that might be interpreted as cheating. Still he was losing,
and still, despite all beliefs to the contrary, he entertained hope, hope that
he might win. If he did win, he told himself, Johnson was enough of a white man
to accept the defeat and leave the horse where he was. Yet his chips were
steadily dwindling; the cards persistently refused to come his way; only once
thus far had he held a winning hand. But he played on, becoming ever more
discouraged, until, suddenly awaking to an unexpectedly good hand, he opened the
pot. The raises followed back and forth swiftly, but he lost again. And now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span> Johnson, as he
mechanically drew the chips toward him, broke the silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Zeke got you all worked up, didn&#8217;t he?&#8221; he declared,
turning his eyes upon Glover. &#8220;As for renegades,&#8221; he went on,
beginning to deal the cards again, &#8220;I&#8217;ve knowed &#8217;em&#8211;hull
droves of &#8217;em&#8211;to stampede on the whistle of a rattler.&#8221;
Evidently he was returning to good humor.</p>

<p>Glover took his pipe from his mouth. &#8220;Renegades gits stirred up every
jest so often,&#8221; he observed. &#8220;I s&#8217;pose it&#8217;s because of the way
they feel about things. Being run offen the reservations thataway ain&#8217;t
nowise pleasant, to begin with, and then havin&#8217; to hang around the aidges
for what grub their folks sees fit for to sneak out to &#8217;em ought to make
it jest that much more monotonous&#8211;kind of. Reckon I&#8217;d break out
myself&#8211;like a man that eats pancakes a lot&#8211;under sich circumstances.
Zeke says this band&#8211;the latest gang to git sore&#8211;is a-headin&#8217;
dead south. Talks like we might run agin trouble down there. More&#8217;n one
brand, too&#8211;the police and the reg&#8217;lars all bein&#8217; out thataway.
They&#8217;re all out&#8211;Zeke says.&#8221;</p>

<p>The others were absorbed in play, and so made no retort. Whereat Glover, with
a reflective light in his eyes, continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen something myself,&#8221; he went on, evidently mindful
of Johnson&#8217;s observation. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen better men than Injuns
stampede on less than rattlesnakes&#8211;and cover a heap more ground in a lot
less shorter time. What I&#8217;m talkin&#8217; <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_182'></a>182</span> about is skunks,&#8221; he explained, to nobody in
particular&#8211;&#8220;hydrophoby skunks&#8211;their bite. Why,&#8221; he
continued, warming to his subject and seemingly ignorant of its myths, &#8220;I
once seen a man ride into San Mercial with his face that white it wouldn&#8217;t
&#8217;a&#8217; showed a chalk mark! And he was holdin&#8217; up his thumb like
it was pizen&#8211;which it was! And he was cuttin&#8217; for old Doc Struthers
that fast his cayuse was sparkin&#8217; out of his ears. Bit by a hydrophoby
skunk&#8211;yes, sirree. Got to the Doc&#8217;s just in time, too! But he allus
was lucky&#8211;the Doc! Money jest rolled into that party all the time. But
some folks don&#8217;t jest quite make it&#8211;horses gives out, or something.
And if they ain&#8217;t got the sand to shoot the finger off&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>A sudden shadow across the window checked him. He quietly reached for his
gun. Also, Johnson lifted quick eyes to the window. And now Jim turned his head.
Directly Glover rose to his feet; Johnson got up off his stool; Jim flung to the
door. A moment they stood tense. Then Jim moved cautiously to the window. He
gazed outside. As he did so his features relaxed. Presently he returned to the
table.</p>

<p>&#8220;That horse,&#8221; he explained, eyes twinkling.</p>

<p>The others returned to their places. All were visibly relieved. But Glover
did not go on with his yarn. Lighting his pipe again, he fell to smoking in
thoughtful silence.</p>

<p>Jim picked up his cards. He saw four kings. But he felt no elation. Before
him was a mere <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
dribble of chips, and he knew that he could not hold out much longer. Johnson
was coldly surveying his own cards, and after a studied moment opened the pot.
Jim thrust forward half his small stack, followed by Johnson with a raise,
whereupon Jim placed all he had upon the board. That closed the game. The other
spread out his cards generously, and Jim, glancing listlessly at four aces, rose
from the table. Turning to the window, he saw Pat still lingering near the
shack. He gazed at him a long moment in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s yours,&#8221; he said, finally, facing Johnson.
&#8220;Reckon I&#8217;ll go outside for a little air.&#8221;</p>

<p>Outside, he made straight for Pat, removed the hobbles, led him into the
grove. As the horse quenched his thirst, Jim sat down with his back against a
tree and removed his hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry, old-timer,&#8221; he began, quietly, &#8220;but it can&#8217;t
be helped. We&#8211;&#8221; He interrupted himself; shoved Pat away a step.
&#8220;That&#8217;s better,&#8221; he went on, smiling. Then, as Pat looked
puzzled, &#8220;On my foot&#8211;yes,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;All of your
own, too, of course!&#8221; he added. &#8220;But one of mine, too!&#8221; He was
silent. &#8220;As I was remarking,&#8221; he continued, after a moment,
&#8220;we&#8217;ve got to beat him some other way. You&#8217;re a likely
horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>He lowered his eyes thoughtfully. He did know of a way to beat Johnson. That
way was to mount Pat, ride hard for the open, and race it out against the little
gray mounted by Johnson. But already he could see the vindictive and cursing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span> Johnson in
pursuit, discharging guns before him. So the idea was hopeless, for he knew that
Johnson even now was alert for some such move. But even if it were feasible, he
realized that he never could rid himself of the man. Others had tried, as he
well recalled&#8211;tried to break away from him for all time, with a result in
no way to Johnson&#8217;s credit. Two had never been seen again, which pointed
grimly to the fact that Johnson lived up to his favorite maxim, which was that
dead men tell no tales. Another was the case of that poor luckless devil who,
through some mysterious workings of the law, having broken with Johnson, had
been arrested and convicted of a crime long forgotten. But Jim knew, as others
closely associated with Johnson knew, that it was Johnson who indirectly had
sent the unfortunate one to the penitentiary. So it required courage, a kind of
unreasoning desperation, to quit the man and the life he led.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jim took a new hold upon himself. What, he began to ask himself, was
getting into him? Why was he suddenly thinking of quitting Johnson? What would
he do if he did quit him? To his kind all decent channels were closed for any
but the exceptional man. But that wasn&#8217;t it! Why was he arguing with
himself along these lines? What was getting into him? He felt as if some good
and powerful influence was come into his life! He had felt like this in Denver
when a Salvation Army lassie had approached him. But this wasn&#8217;t Denver!
Nor was there <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span> a
woman! What was it, anyway? He could not decide.</p>

<p>He arose and laid his hand upon Pat&#8217;s forelock.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a regular case,&#8221; he said, leading the horse out of
the grove, &#8220;for something to turn up. It generally does, anyway,&#8221; he
concluded. &#8220;Don&#8217;t it, Old Gravity?&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span><a id='link_16'></a>CHAPTER XVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>PAT TURNS THIEF</span></h2>

<p>A week passed before Pat knew of his change in masters. But that was not
strange. Busily engaged in keeping himself alive on scant herbage, he took but
little interest in anything else. Besides, his young friend continued to make
much of him, talking in soothing tones and gently stroking his sides, and the
little gray, holding herself faithfully near, also maintained quiet evidence of
friendliness. So he had no reason to suspect change. But one morning, with camp
broken, and saddle-bags flung out, and the window sealed over, and the door shut
and barred, and the other horses bridled and saddled, there came to him in the
person of the large man himself&#8211;a person he had instinctively
disliked&#8211;the first sign of the change in his fortune.</p>

<p>The man approached, bridle on arm, to remove his hobbles. He remained
motionless under this, and prepared also to accept the bridle quietly. But in
bridling him the man was rough to an extent he had never before
known&#8211;forcing an oddly shaped bit against his tongue, and twisting and
turning his sensitive ears as if these delicate <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_187'></a>187</span> organs were so much refractory leather or metal.
Then came the saddle, and with it further torture. The forward belt was made
snug, which he was accustomed to and expected; but when the rear girdle was
cinched so tight that he found difficulty in breathing, he became nervous and
wanted to protest. It was all very unusual, this rough handling, and he did not
understand it. The effect of the tight cinch was peculiar, too. With the knot
tied firmly, he felt girded as for some great undertaking, his whole nervous
system seemed to center in his stomach, and all his wonted freedom and buoyancy
seemed compressed and smothered. With all this, and the man in the saddle and
spurring viciously, he realized grimly the change in masters.</p>

<p>They set out at a fox-trot, continuing their southwesterly direction. It was
an unmarked course from the beginning, leading them steadily down into the
Mogollon range, and, as before, Johnson was occupying the lead, with Jim next
behind, and Glover bringing up the rear. And, as on the first leg of the
journey, all rode in silence.</p>

<p>So Pat was in the lead, and while he found his new master half as heavy again
as the other, he also found compensation for the increased weight in the
position which he occupied. Not that he was proud to be in the lead; nothing
from the beginning of this adventure had caused a thrill of either joy or pride.
But he did find in his new place freedom from dust cast up by the heels of <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span> his companions, and he
trotted along in contentment, to all outward appearances. But it was only an
appearance of content. Within were mixed emotions. While he felt pleasure at
being active again, while he was resigned in a way to his hunger pangs, and he
was glad that his friends, the little gray and the young man, were still with
him, yet against all this was a sense of revolt at the unnecessary tightness of
the cinch, the hard hand on the reins, and the frequent touch of spur and heel
and stirrup against his sides. Finally the feeling which began at that initial
torture in bridling swelled with the consequent annoyances into approaching
revolt. He became ugly and morose.</p>

<p>This soon revealed itself. He was crossing a wide arroyo. Without counting
costs, grimly blind to the result, he burst out of the fox-trot into a canter.
He held to this a thrilling moment, and then, finding himself keyed to greater
exertions, abandoned the canter and broke into a sharp run. It was all done
quickly, the changes of stride lapping almost within his own length, and his
heart leaped and pounded with delight, for the change somehow relieved him.</p>

<p>But it was a mistake. Quickly as it was done, he found himself almost as
quickly jerked up, swung viciously around, and his sides raked with ruthless
spurs. He gasped a moment under the smarting fire of the spurs, then, as in the
old days, reared in a towering rage. And this was a mistake. Too late he found
the man&#8217;s <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
weight overbalancing him. He struggled to recover himself, plunged over
backward, and down, striking the earth heavily. Hurriedly he regained his feet,
but not so the man, not till the others sprang to his assistance. Then he
realized what he had done, realized it fully as he caught the venomous gleam in
the man&#8217;s eyes and heard the storm of abuse volleying from his lips. Then,
looking at the man, and listening to his raging outburst, he conjured up out of
the dim past memories of the Mexican hostler and of that single encounter in the
white corral. And now his fear for the man left him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll kill him! I&#8217;ll shoot the horse!&#8221; roared
Johnson, his face yellow underneath the tan. He reached toward his
side-arms.</p>

<p>But he did not shoot. With his face white and drawn Jim strode to Pat&#8217;s
head, while Glover, quick to understand, played the solicitous attendant,
assisting the limping Johnson into the saddle. And that closed the incident.
Presently all were riding along again, with Johnson, wincing under internal
distress, holding his reins more loosely than before.</p>

<p>But it was not without its good. As on that other occasion in the corral, Pat
had learned something. He had measured a man, and he knew, and knew that the man
knew, that he had come off victor. But it gave him no secret gratification. He
continued to trot along, holding steadily to the gait, subtly aware of the
slackened rein and of the wrenched and loosened girdle, until, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span> with the coming of noon,
the blessed relief from the weight of the man, the ill-fitting saddle, and the
over-tight girth, came also an agreeable surprise. He was turned out to graze
without hobble or tether, and for this consideration he felt faint glimmerings
of respect for his new master. Making free at first with the other horses, he
set off to enjoy to the full his new-found liberty.</p>

<p>But as he pursued ever farther the elusive vegetation in the joy of freedom,
he presently awoke to his great distance from camp, and, indeed, from the other
horses. Conscious of a sudden gripping loneliness and a certain apprehension, he
began to retrace his way. As he did so, out of the silence came a nasty whirring
sound, and suddenly he felt a rope settle over his head. Surprise, then anger,
displaced his loneliness and apprehension; he jerked back to escape the rope.
But it held fast. He braced his legs and began to pull steadily. But the harder
he pulled the worse the rope choked him. Finally he ceased all effort and turned
his eyes along the rope. At the far end stood the little mare, legs braced in
the sand, and astride her, stolid and grim, and with eyes narrowed, the figure
of the large man. At sight of him Pat began to pull again, more through ugliness
now than desire to escape, until he found that he was dragging the little gray
out of her stiffened hold. Then he slackened off. Also, as she wheeled back
toward camp, he set out amiably after her. In camp he found his young friend
scattering and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
deadening the coals of the camp-fire, and the little man making up the
saddle-bags. This told him that the journey was to be resumed, and he stood
quiet and peaceful as he was being bridled and saddled, and afterward he trotted
along under the guidance of his master without show of anger or rebellion.
Indeed, though the sun was hot, and the unmarked trail tedious, and the weight
on his back heavier than ever, he felt less fretful and more contented than at
any time since leaving the little ranch beside the river&#8211;possibly because
of the thrill of his double encounter.</p>

<p>Ahead and on either hand the desert soon began to break and lift. As they
went on the dunes grew to be hills and heights, growing, looming, closing in
upon them. Now and again a clump of trees or a shoulder of rock or a stretch of
foliage stepped out in relief against the brown of the landscape, revealing more
than once ideal grazing-land. Also, as they penetrated deeper into this broken
country, the sky overhead showed change. From a spotless blue it revealed tiny
splotches of gray-white cloud scudding before upper currents. With the passing
hours these clouds became heavy, sullen, and threatening, until the sun, dipping
into the west, sinking in a kind of hazy moisture, left the heavens completely
overcast, cold and bleak and forbidding&#8211;a dense mass of cloud-banks down
to the tip of ridge and range. And now came dusk, short and chill, and with it
the slow ascent of a long grade, leading them up to a ridge, low and ragged,
trailing away interminably to north and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_192'></a>192</span> south in the gloom. Complete darkness found them
deep among high hills.</p>

<p>The men drew rein beside a little stream. They watered the horses, and then,
throwing off saddle-bags and gathering brush, they built a tiny fire. Glover
appeared nervous and worried, and when the meal was ended turned to mount and be
off again. But Johnson called him back. Johnson was seated on the ground, close
beside Jim, and Glover sat down with them. Thus they waited, silent, reflective,
watching, while about them pressed the close night, seeming by its touch to
impart to them something of its solemnity. Off at one side the horses, bridled
and saddled, waited also&#8211;watching and waiting, motionless, and over them
all brooded a stillness that was mighty and portentous. Thus they waited for two
hours, wrapped in profound silence, and then Johnson, after scanning the sky,
rose and made for the horses. The others quickly followed him. Their trail led
into a narrow defile. Up this winding way they rode, with Johnson in the lead,
up and ever up, until they burst through a clump of brush at the top. There they
drew rein and again waited, silent, reflective, watching. Presently Glover, with
eyes turned eastward, uttered a grunt which meant relief.</p>

<p>The clouds in the eastern sky were breaking. Through the heavy banks came a
faint glimmering of moonlight. At first but a hair-line, it widened out,
reaching up and across the sky, developing steadily into the semblance of a
frozen flash of <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
heat lightning, until all the eastern heavens showed a shimmering expanse,
broken here and there by black clouds sullenly holding their own, which flooded
the underscudding desert in beautiful mottled gray-green coloring. Wider and
wider the light spread, up and away on either hand, moving stealthily across the
sky, until the sheen of it broke over the ridge itself, and then swept beyond to
the west, laying bare a broad expanse of mesa dotted with gray-green specks that
told of the presence of hundreds of cattle. And now the sullen clouds took to
weaving, swaying under the pressure of upper-air currents, the specks below
beginning to lift and fall with the motion of the clouds like bits of wreckage
undulate on the sea. The air-drifts descended, came closer, fanning the cheeks
of the men, rustling through the leaves which crowned the ridge, and breaking
the heavy silence. The air-currents flicked the desert with their freight of
swift-moving shadows, causing strange movement among the bits of
wreckage&#8211;the cattle. It was a glorious march, lighting up the western
expanse beneath and revealing a flat country, unbroken by dune or cleft as far
as the eye could penetrate. So the light moved on, crowding before it sullen
shadows which presently disappeared.</p>

<p>Johnson broke the stillness. &#8220;We&#8217;d better move along down,&#8221;
he said, and shook Pat&#8217;s reins.</p>

<p>The horses began the long descent. As compared with the upward climb they
made slow progress. Forced to feel their way, they moved <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span> always in halts and starts, over
saplings, around bulging rocks, along narrow ledges, and at length gained the
mesa, where the men drew rein. Johnson, sweeping his eyes coolly over the field
of his campaign, began to give orders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; he snapped, &#8220;cut in over there&#8211;that
arroyo&#8211;and crowd &#8217;em around to the south. Don&#8217;t go too
deep.&#8221; Then, as Jim caught up his reins, &#8220;Glover, swing off this
side&#8211;close in. We&#8217;ll keep close in down to the line. Hop
along!&#8221;</p>

<p>Pat remained standing. He turned his eyes after the little gray and her
rider. He saw the pair swing up over a rise of ground at a gallop, dip from view
into a hollow, and appear again on the level beyond. Across this they rode,
speeding to the opposite slopes, then slackening as they ascended, making
quietly among the nervous cattle, horses and riders moving with the easy
certainty that told of much experience. Then he saw the head and shoulders of
the young man above the surging herd, crowding a part of it slowly in his
direction, to the right, to the left, forward and around, always making steadily
toward him. It was interesting, and he continued to watch the cool steadiness of
the man and the easy control of the horse, until he caught sight of the other,
riding the opposite flank, but also crowding steadily toward him. He fell to
watching this man, who, not so tall as Jim among the herd, but as quietly
active, was also pressing to right and left and forward and around among the
cattle, relentlessly cutting them out. Soon there was a general <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span> forward movement, the
young man riding on the far side, the little man closing up the rear, and this
brought the whole herd, some bellowing loudly, others in sullen silence, still
others contentedly munching, directly opposite. Then he felt the prick of spurs,
and, throwing himself eagerly at the task, he galloped around behind the
advancing cattle, falling into the position now abandoned by the little man, who
cantered around and forward upon the left flank. It was exciting, and for a
moment he thrilled. Then came the only interruption.</p>

<p>A big steer, breaking suddenly out of the herd, tore madly to the rear. Pat,
nearest the escaping beef, was spurred in pursuit. It was unexpected, the
spurring, and it was savage, and, jolted out of soothing reflection, he
flattened his ears and balked. The man spurred him again and again and again,
finally raking his sides mercilessly. Whereupon Pat balked in earnest, bucking
and pitching viciously. At this the man swung his quirt, cutting Pat repeatedly
over head and ears. Yet Pat continued to plunge, holding grimly to his lesson,
which was to teach this man the futility of this treatment. He did not throw the
man off, but neither did he go ahead. Finally the man ceased his brutality, and
evidently coming to understand, headed Pat after the moving herd without spur or
quirt. Then Pat, though still rankling under the cruelty, sprang eagerly
forward, desirous of showing his willingness to serve when rightly used.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>That was all.
The night passed quietly, the men, alert to their tasks, each separated from the
other, riding stolidly into golden dawn. But not till late, with the sun
half-way to its zenith, and then only because of safe distance from possible
detection, did they draw rein. Saddle-bags were thrown off, though bridle and
saddle were left on in case of emergency, and the horses were turned out on
short tethers. The men risked a fire, since they were in the shadow of a ridge,
and when the coffee-pot was steaming seated themselves on the ground, in a close
circle. For the first time since midnight one spoke. It was Johnson.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll hold west of Lordsburg,&#8221; he declared, sweeping his
eyes gloatingly over the herd. &#8220;Francisco Espor and his gang over the
line&#8217;ll weep when they see that bunch&#8211;for joy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jim leaned back upon one elbow. &#8220;What was that rumpus last
night,&#8221; he inquired, &#8220;right after we started?&#8221; Then he showed
his thoughts. &#8220;I mean, the horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnson swung his head around. For a moment he appeared not to understand.
Then suddenly his eyes lost their good-humored twinkle and grew hard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lost one,&#8221; he answered, abruptly. &#8220;The horse
stalled.&#8221; He narrowed his eyes as he stared vindictively at Pat. &#8220;I
must take a day off, after we get over the line,&#8221; he snapped, &#8220;and
break that animal to saddle, bridle, spur, quirt, and rope. He &#8217;ain&#8217;t
never been broke, that horse, and he&#8217;s naturally mean!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>Jim sat up.
&#8220;Not with me,&#8221; he declared, quietly, &#8220;when we got acquainted.
You ain&#8217;t taking him right, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnson eyed him surlily. &#8220;You&#8217;re a wonderful piece!&#8221; he
snapped; and then, by glint of eye and jerk of head showed that he dismissed the
subject.</p>

<p>But Jim seemed to feel otherwise. &#8220;Maybe I am,&#8221; he retorted,
turning absent eyes in the direction of the horse. &#8220;But I ain&#8217;t all.
I happen to know of another wonderful piece. I&#8217;m only a one-territory
piece.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnson grinned. &#8220;Go on,&#8221; he urged, politely.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no &#8216;go on&#8217; to it,&#8221; rejoined Jim, revealing
equal politeness. &#8220;I&#8217;m only thinking of a piece I happen to know
that runs about a man that&#8217;s wanted more or less in seven states and two
territories. Running double, he&#8217;s hard to get.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnson reached over coolly and struck him nastily across the mouth. Then as
coolly he sat back, while Jim slowly rose to his feet. His eyes were
blazing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; he said, tensely. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard a lot about
your killings,&#8221; he went on, breathless with anger. &#8220;I guess maybe
that&#8217;s the way&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; broke in Glover, excitedly, his eyes upon the ridge to
the east.</p>

<p>The others turned. Moving slowly along the crest, disappearing, reappearing,
disappearing again, was the figure of a man. They gazed a long moment, when the
figure dropped from view again. They continued to gaze, silent, rigid, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span> watchful, peering
narrowly against the morning sunlight. Presently the figure reappeared, lower
against the gray background, moving slowly as before, evidently crouching. Lower
it came, quarter down the slope, half-way, then again disappeared. Johnson broke
the tense silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sheepherder!&#8221; he snapped, and turned savage eyes back upon
Jim.</p>

<p>But Glover leaped to his feet. &#8220;If that&#8217;s a sheepherder,&#8221;
he cried, making for the horses at a run, &#8220;then I&#8217;m a
sheep!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span><a id='link_17'></a>CHAPTER XVII<br /><span class='h2fs'>A RUNNING FIGHT</span></h2>

<p>A rifle-shot forced instant action. Jim whirled away from the camp-fire and
saddle-bags and sprang toward the horses, while Johnson, leaping up with the
agile twist of an athlete, gained his feet running. Jim headed grimly for Pat,
but Johnson reached him a breath in advance. Snatching up the reins and
mounting, he dug Pat viciously with his huge rowels. At that Pat balked. The man
swore and cursed and spurred again; but the horse remained obdurate. Seeing
this, Johnson stopped spurring. Thereupon Pat flung forward, dragging his tether
clear of its stake, and crowded close beside the gray. Jim was mounted on the
gray, bending low in the saddle, racing in frantic pursuit of Glover. Mounted on
the sorrel, Glover was well in the lead, speeding straight into the west, riding
at right angles to the ridge, galloping hard for the open desert. The echo of
the shot reverberated again faintly, and around them closed a tense silence.</p>

<p>Others were making for the open. Out of the underbrush, riding easily, burst
a handful of rangers. Stephen was one of them. As they <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span> swept into the clear country,
well-armed, well-mounted, the look on their strong, bronzed faces told of their
purpose, which was to get the thieves alive, if possible. Down the long slope
they galloped, hats low against the sunlight, elbows winging slightly, heads and
backs slanting to the winds, speeding like a group of centaurs. Other than
Stephen, there were four of these range police. Men of insight, of experience,
keen in the ways of the lawless, knowing best of all the type ahead, they rode
without strain, without urging, knowing that this was a long race, a matter of
endurance, a test, not for themselves so much as for the horses, those of the
pursued as well as their own. Loosely scattered, they rode, eyes not upon the
thieves, but upon the horses carrying the thieves, as if hopeful for another
break like that shown at the start by the magnificent black.</p>

<p>Thus rode the rangers. Not so Stephen. Stephen knew no such laws. All he knew
was that after long weeks of futile riding, here at last was Helen&#8217;s Pat
galloping madly away from him. Lashing and spurring his own bay mare, resolute
and determined, he gradually began to pull away from the others.</p>

<p>Ahead, Johnson began slowly to gather in his trailing tether-rope. Almost
without visible effort he wound it around his saddle-horn. Whereupon Jim,
evidently aroused to like danger of tripping, set to work at the loop around the
little gray&#8217;s neck. The knot was tight, and his position <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span> cramped, but he
persisted, and, with it loose, tossed the rope away. Glover already was free
from his trailing rope, having taken the time at the outset hurriedly to cast it
off. And he was still in the lead, the sorrel carrying him without seeming
effort, and moving steadily away from the others, each long stride gaining half
as much ground again as the swinging gait of Pat or the quick and nervous
reaching of the little gray. But all were moving at top speed, racing
desperately across the desert, leaping sand-dunes, dipping into hollows,
mounting eagerly over larger dunes, on and on like the wind, sending up with
each fling of hoof swirling clouds of dust and gravel. It was a grim effort.</p>

<p>Such a time comes to but few men. And such a crisis tests the mettle of men
and shows the differences. Gripped in a primal emotion, fear for life, weak men
show strength, and strong men weakness. Harmless men murder, murderous men weep,
blasphemous men pray, praying men curse. Yet under such a stress strong men
often reveal greater strength, rising to physical and spiritual heights of
reserve that mock a following fate, even as praying men often pray harder and
more fervently than ever they prayed in times of calm. Individual in peace,
mankind is individual in war. It is the way of man.</p>

<p>And thus it was with these three hurtling forward in the shadow of doom.
Glover, ever weak, ever apprehensive, yet always considerate of others, now
revealed unexpected strength and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_202'></a>202</span> appeared considerate only of himself. Crouching in
his saddle, apparently mindful of but a single thing&#8211;escape&#8211;he
lashed his horse brutally, swinging his quirt rhythmically, now and again
darting cold eyes backward. Johnson, given by nature to bravado and bluster, was
even more defiant in this supreme moment. He rode with a plug of tobacco in
hand, biting off huge pieces frequently, more frequently squirting brown juices
between lips white as the telltale ring around his mouth&#8211;a ring as
expressive as the hollows beneath his glittering eyes. And Jim, ever worried,
ever conscious of himself, sat in his saddle easily, now that he was about to
reap the harvest of his ill-sown seeds, riding with eyes on the horse
alongside&#8211;Pat&#8211;studying with coolly critical gaze the animal&#8217;s
smoothness of gait, wonderful carriage of head, unusual and beautiful lifting of
forelegs. Thus, in this valley of the shadow, each was his true self and
something more, or less, as the chaotic spirit within viewed the immediate
future or scanned the distant past.</p>

<p>Another shot from the posse&#8211;a screaming bullet high overhead&#8211;a
command to stop! But they did not stop. Instead, Johnson, rising in his
stirrups, unholstered a huge revolver and fired point-blank at the rangers. It
was the wrong thing to do, and instantly Jim drew away from the leader. This
left a clear gap between, and exposed the speeding Glover ahead to fire from the
rear. And suddenly it came, a volley of rifle-shots, and Glover, stiffening
suddenly, was seen to clutch at <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_203'></a>203</span> his saddle-horn. Also, he turned his head and
shoulders as if to cry out. But he uttered not a sound. Evidently the jostling
of his sorrel forbade. He turned his head to the front again, and, slumping low
in his saddle, began frantic use of spur and quirt. But the sorrel had lost his
stride, and before he could regain it Jim and Johnson had dashed alongside. Jim
swung close and looked at Glover. Glover returned the gaze, and again appeared
about to speak. But now the sorrel flung forward into his stride, and the
movement seemed to decide Glover against all utterance.</p>

<p>But Jim understood. He held close to Glover, but turned his eyes after
Johnson. Instantly he scowled and his mouth drew grimly down. For Johnson was
swinging off at a tangent, riding out of the set direction, rapidly pulling away
from them. For one sullen moment Jim regarded him; then turned his head to the
rear. One of the rangers, a young man mounted on a graceful bay&#8211;with the
rangers, yet apparently not one of them&#8211;was riding well forward out of the
group. Understanding Johnson&#8217;s move now, comprehending his utter
selfishness in thus swinging away from them, Jim gazed pityingly at Glover. But
Glover did not notice him. He himself was following the swift-riding Johnson
with blazing eyes, and suddenly he exploded in vindictive anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put a hole in him!&#8221; he cried, hoarsely. &#8220;Shoot him! Shoot
him, Jim! I&#8211;I can&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>But neither could Jim. It was not his nature. Yet there was one thing he
could do. And this he <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_204'></a>204</span> did. He took fresh hold on the reins, and, grim and
deliberate and vengeful, swung about after Johnson. Further, in swinging his
horse about he purposely crowded the sorrel over also. This brought both in
direct pursuit of Johnson, and soon they overtook him. But not because of their
greater speed.</p>

<p>Suffering from an unwonted raking of spurs, Pat had taken to sudden
rebellion&#8211;balking at first, then beginning to buck, flinging about in all
directions except the way desired by the fugitive on his back. Riding close and
noting this, Jim felt glad beyond all decency. He even chuckled with
satisfaction, conscious almost of a desire to dismount and hug the black. Then
his feeling changed. He regretted his glee, became fearful for the man, and
called sharply to the horse. And now Pat came to a stand. This for a moment
only. Then of his own accord he sprang forward again, speeding as eagerly now as
but a moment before he had rebelled, and soon he was galloping alongside the
gray. Eminently pleased with the whole performance, Jim again chuckled in
delight and burst forward at top speed.</p>

<p>Nor was this rebellion lost on Stephen. Riding well forward of the others,
when he saw Pat offering resistance he whipped and spurred his mount in the hope
that Pat would hold out. But Pat did not hold out, though Stephen knew that he
would have, had he but understood. Also, there was his handicap&#8211;handicap
of the others also. Neither he nor they dared to fire lest they should <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span> shoot the black.
Occasionally the thieves spread apart, thus giving a chance for a shot with safe
regard for Pat. But these openings were infrequent. All they could do was ride
in the hope that the thieves might be seized with panic at last and give
themselves up.</p>

<p>But no such thought came to the fugitives. Johnson, after his galling
experience with Pat, looked more grimly determined than ever to get away.
Presently he struck back again. He drew a revolver, rose in his stirrups, and
fired twice to the rear. It was not without result. Up from the rangers swept a
chorus of yells, and Jim, turning his head, saw the foremost pursuer, the young
man who was evidently not a ranger, circle headlong over his tumbling horse. He
turned to the front again, and, understanding what would follow, whipped and
spurred furiously. Suddenly the answer came. The desert awoke in a fusillade of
shots, and Jim saw Glover, who once more was in the lead, drift out of his
saddle, slip down much as a child descends from its high-chair, and fall to
earth in a crumpled heap. He swerved and dashed alongside. For an instant he
drew rein and studied the still face. Then he lifted his eyes, gazing off
absently toward the distant skyline, the mellow haze in the hills, the
shimmering of heat-waves above the dunes, the glistening reflections of light
off myriads of tiny sand cubes. Glover&#8211;poor Glover&#8211;had paid the
price, and had paid it in silence.</p>

<p>He wheeled his horse and sped after Johnson. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_206'></a>206</span> He overtook him swinging up over a slight
elevation. Dead ahead, not more than two miles distant, he saw a long grove of
trees. It gave him hope. Here was a chance for effective resistance. Here both
he and Johnson could dismount, drive the horses into shelter, seek shelter
themselves, and open fire upon the posse. His spirits kindled. He would shoot to
kill, as he knew Johnson would shoot to kill, and then, with the rangers
helplessly disabled, he would mount Pat, mount the black this time, and if
Johnson became ugly he would shoot him. Then he would ride to the east, ride out
of this life, and with the horse take up a decent existence somewhere,
abandoning crime forever. He would&#8211;</p>

<p>More shots from the rear interrupted him. Evidently the rangers, mounting
over the rise themselves, had also caught sight of the grove. Evidently, too,
they were taking no chances against such a stand as he was contemplating. At any
rate, the firing became rapid and continuous, and it was deadly, for suddenly he
saw Johnson wilt in the saddle, drop his revolver, drop the reins, and clutch at
his left arm. Also he heard a cry&#8211;heard it sharp and clear above the
pounding of the gray&#8217;s hoofs and the creak and crunch of his own
saddle-leather.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hit! I&#8217;m hit, boy! They&#8211;they&#8217;ve got
me!&#8221; Pat himself heard the outcry and felt the loosened rein. It puzzled
him. He did not know whether to keep going or to slacken down. But he kept on
going&#8211;going hard. Yet he would have welcomed a halt. He was weak and
faint. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span> He could
not remember the time, save that memorable day on the mesa, when he had run so
hard and so continuously. Yet ahead lay trees, and instinctively he accepted
them as his destination. In that grove perhaps was water, an opportunity for
rest, and abundance of food. So he continued forward, grimly conscious of his
burning ankles, his pounding and fluttering heart and heaving and clamoring
lungs&#8211;plunging forward under the weak urging of his heavy master,
responding now through force of habit&#8211;feeling that because he was in
motion he must continue in motion. It was a numb, mechanical effort, involuntary
and apart from him, as much apart from his control as was the beating of his
heart.</p>

<p>Another volley came from the rear, and with it another violent change in his
master. The man cried out and loosened his feet in the stirrups. Yet Pat
continued to gallop until he felt the weight slowly leaving him, felt it go
altogether, felt it dangling from one stirrup. Then he came to a stop. As he did
so the little gray dashed past&#8211;his friend. And now great loneliness
gripped him. He started forward. But the weight in his stirrup checked him. He
came to a stop again. Then he wanted to nicker in protest, but he found that he
could not. He was too weak to utter sound. So he stood there, his eyes upon the
little gray and her rider, watching them hurtling toward the grove. Then the
thudding of hoofs came to his ears from the rear, and, slowly turning, he saw a
group of horsemen riding wearily&#8211;one hatless; <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span> another with flaying quirt; a third
with smoking carbine; a fourth, a large man, smooth and red of face, riding
heavily&#8211;all galloping toward him.</p>

<p>But they did not hold his interest. His heart and soul lay with the little
gray mare, and, turning to the front again, he saw mare and rider swinging out
of sight around the end of the grove. Confidently he watched for their
appearance beyond. Presently he saw them sweep into view again&#8211;moving at a
gallop, swinging across a wide plain that held them clear to his straining
eyes&#8211;saw them grow faint and fainter, small and ever smaller&#8211;become
a hazy speck on the horizon&#8211;finally disappear from view in the engulfing
dunes and vales of the surrounding desert. And now, weakened as he was, he
sounded a forlorn, protracted nicker of protest.</p>

<p>The rangers pulled up, breathless. They dismounted stiffly, released the
weight from Pat&#8217;s stirrup, and carried it off a little ways. He watched
them a moment, noting their ease of movement and business-like air, and then
turned his gaze to the horses. All were strange to him, and he looked them over
frankly, resting his eyes finally upon a chunky white. Instinctively he knew
that this horse was mean, and he hated mean horses as he hated mean men.
Observing that this one showed his teeth freely at him, the while holding his
small ears almost constantly flat, he measured him for difficulties in the
future, if the association were to continue. Then he turned his eyes back to the
men.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>As he did so,
out of the silence rode a single horseman. He was mounted upon the sorrel, and
Pat wondered at this. But as the man drew near and Pat saw a blood-smeared,
ghastly face, he wondered still more. For there was something familiar about
this lone rider, and he took a step toward him. Presently he saw him gain the
outer edge of the circle, and then a strange thing happened. He saw the young
man begin to weave in his saddle, saw two of the others suddenly leap for
him&#8211;saw them reach him just in time to save him from tumbling limply to
the ground. Then he noted another queer thing. He saw the young man&#8217;s left
arm dangle oddly from the shoulder; saw the young man himself grasp it, wincing
with excruciating pain, and saw him turn wide eyes suddenly toward him. Then he
heard the man speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look&#8211;look him over!&#8221; he cried, and his voice was a curious
mixture of distress and restrained excitement. &#8220;I&#8211;I don&#8217;t want
him&#8211;him to go back&#8211;to go back&#8211;hurt&#8211;hurt
in&#8211;in&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>And now Pat saw the strangest thing of all. He saw the young man slowly close
his eyes and sink back into the arms of the others as one dead. He saw the
others exchange troubled glances and lay the insensible form down tenderly on
the sand. It was all very unusual, something new in his life; and, not knowing
what else to do, yet somehow feeling that he should do something, be it never so
little, he lowered his head and sounded a trembling nicker into the silence.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span><a id='link_18'></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>AN ENEMY</span></h2>

<p>There was water in the grove, and the men made camp at the edge of the trees.
&#8220;The Doc,&#8221; which was what the rangers early had affectionately
nicknamed Stephen, was suffering a compound fracture of the left arm, together
with numerous bruises and scratches about the head and face. He had had a nasty
fall. His horse had stumbled and almost instantly died as the result of the big
cattle-rustler&#8217;s shots. The men set and splinted Stephen&#8217;s arm as
best they could, and they bandaged his head with rare skill; but it was deemed
advisable for him to remain quiet for a time.</p>

<p>So Stephen lay listlessly smiling at the bantering of the men, too sick at
heart really to take interest in any living thing. His arm pained him, and his
head ached, while throughout his body he was sore and stiff and well-nigh
incapable of moving. But not once following the first complete collapse did he
let go of himself, although when the men set his arm it seemed that he must.
Somehow he was contented that everything was as it was. True, he was hurt. But
also he had found Pat, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_211'></a>211</span> had recovered the horse for Helen, and the horse
now was within sound of his voice, did he but care to lift it. His physical
hurts would get well, his spiritual hurts never without the recovery of the
horse. And now he had the horse.</p>

<p>One morning it became apparent that their food-supplies would soon need
replenishing. So it was decided to break camp for the nearest town, a Mexican
settlement some eighty miles to the southwest. Stephen had been walking about
somewhat cheerfully for three or four days, and his condition was such that he
could ride forward slowly without danger to his arm. So they broke camp,
utilizing the sorrel as a pack-horse&#8211;there now were two extra saddles and
bridles&#8211;and set out, Stephen, of course, mounted upon Pat.</p>

<p>Once more Pat found himself following an unmarked and desolate trail. Moving
always at a walk now instead of the conventional fox-trot, he found his service,
save for this and one other thing, identical with that under his previous
masters. The single other difference was that instead of irritating silence,
these men unwittingly soothed him with their talk and swift exchange of jokes.
Thus the hours passed, until noon came, when, with his bridle and saddle
removed, and pungent odors of savory cooking tickling his nostrils, he received
the privilege of grazing over the whole desert unhobbled and untethered. But
this, liberal as it seemed, brought him nothing of the nourishment his soul
craved. After an hour or two of lazy wandering, while the men passed <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span> the time at cards, he
was sent forward again along the ever-mysterious trail. And thus he moved,
through the long hot afternoon, the cool and lingering twilight, on to a night
camp where once more he was turned loose with the other horses to glean as best
he might life-giving sustenance from the scant herbage. But it was drearily
monotonous.</p>

<p>Throughout it all, however, there was one who kept his interest alive. It was
the white horse. In the camp holding himself aloof, as if superciliously
refraining from close contact, on the trail this horse took to revealing his
antagonism. He would stand a short way from him while they grazed, lay back his
ears and whisk his tail, and, whenever the chance came, he would snap viciously
at the other horses. Pat understood the meaning of all this, and held himself
ready to resist attack, yet he simply looked at the horse with a kind of amused
speculation. Nor at any time did he feel grave apprehension. That he did not
take the horse seriously lay in the fact that after drawing near in this fashion
and bristling nastily the white horse would quickly draw away again, steadily
and craftily, and then fall to worrying one of the other horses, usually one of
smaller size that quite obviously feared him.</p>

<p>There came the time when the white did not confine his threatenings to the
grazing-periods. He became aggressive on the march. Though less free to give
battle here, which was possibly his reason, he would frequently jockey close,
and either <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span> flash
his head around with teeth snapping, or else, as if to make Pat feel
inferiority, would plunge forward to a point immediately in front, and in this
position fling back choking dust or gravel. At such times the round-faced man,
the white&#8217;s master, would drag him away mightily, or, if he was not quick
enough, then the sorrel, drowsing along behind on a lead-rope, would
unconsciously offer resistance. But it was all very disagreeable, and Pat, while
finding that it broke up the monotony of the journey, yet at length found
himself also becoming irritated.</p>

<p>He finally gave way to it. It was his nature to brood over annoyances and
sometimes to heap grains of injustice into mountains of woes. He fell to
thinking of his general lot, his misfortunes, the lack of proper food, the
occasional lack of water, until he became sullen and peevish. The change showed
in sudden starts at unusual sounds which brought sharp protests from his young
master, and then he began to refuse to eat. This was grave, and he knew it. But
he could not or would not help it; he never knew quite which it was. But he did
not eat. Instead of moving about with the other horses, nose to ground, mouthing
the bunch-grass, he would mope by himself well away from the other horses,
standing with head hanging and ears inert, all in motionless silence. As the
water-holes became farther apart, and the grazing worse yet, he did this more
and more, until the white horse, evidently seeing his lack of spirit, became a
source of downright aggravation, frequently <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_214'></a>214</span> taking lightning nips at him. At such times Pat
would lift his head and hold himself erect and vigilant during the
grazing-period, but he brooded, none the less, and as persistently refused to
eat.</p>

<p>This was not lost upon Stephen or the rangers, neither his refusing to eat
nor the white&#8217;s antagonism. They spent hours discussing both. Having found
in Pat none of the regular symptoms of disease, yet aware that something grave
was the matter, the rangers fell to discussing Pat&#8217;s condition with much
earnestness, frequently interrupting their arguments on the one subject to
declare that the white horse, provided Pat held out and healed up against his
complaint, would get a fight such as was never before witnessed in the desert.
That they were evenly matched both as to build and strength was recognized; that
Pat was possessed of a reserve that told of finer courage all agreed. Yet in
this last lurked opportunities for argument; and argue they did, sometimes long
into the night, the little man known as the Professor and the rangy individual
with the scrubby beard showing the greatest vehemence. Yet despite all their
arguments, to which Stephen invariably listened in smiling silence, none as yet
had offered good reason for the villainous attitude of the white toward the
peaceful Pat.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> know!&#8221; suddenly declared the man with the scrubby beard
one evening, after the tin dishes had been cleared away. &#8220;It&#8217;s
jealousy!&#8221; He narrowed his eyes out through the darkness in the direction
of the horses. &#8220;Who ever &#8217;u&#8217;d believe <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span> old Tom out there &#8217;u&#8217;d show
jealousy? I see it, though, the first day. You recollect we made a heap of the
black, kind of petting him up some, and Tom, bein&#8217;, as he sure is, an
intelligent hoss, I reckon he figured it out that he&#8217;d played the game and
been faithful all along, and then to see himself set back that way by a complete
stranger, it jest nachelly made him sore. Same as it would you or me, mebbe, if
we was informed polite and all that from headquarters that they was a new man
comin&#8217; to jine us that was the pure quill whichever way you looked at him.
Old Tom is bein&#8217; et up with jealousy, I&#8217;m regretful to
say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Animiles feels things a heap more&#8217;n humans does,&#8221; put in
the little man known as the Professor. &#8220;But they&#8217;re more reserved in
showin&#8217; &#8217;em out. Yit when they do show &#8217;em out, they&#8217;re
a lot less polite about it than humans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nachelly,&#8221; snapped the lean man, glaring savagely across the
fire at the other. &#8220;But that ain&#8217;t tellin&#8217; us what ails the
black,&#8221; he went on, dropping the subject of the white and taking up with
the symptoms of the black, evidently through perverseness. &#8220;He&#8217;s
solemn and dumpish,&#8221; he declared, thoughtfully, &#8220;like he might have
distemper. But he &#8217;ain&#8217;t got distemper. And his teeth ain&#8217;t sharp,
yet he don&#8217;t eat at all. And I can&#8217;t see anything the matter with
his insides.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you look?&#8221; inquired the Professor, innocently, but with a
quick wink at Stephen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8211;&#8221; began the lean man, only to check himself with an
angry snort. Then he shifted <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_216'></a>216</span> the topic again, reverting to the case of old Tom.
&#8220;That white hoss&#8217;ll about push that matter to a finish,&#8221; he
declared. &#8220;See if what I say don&#8217;t pan out! Tom he&#8217;ll just
about obey that law o&#8217; nature which animals has knowed from long before
the ark, but which us humans is just gettin&#8217; a hold on. He&#8217;ll remove
the cause&#8211;old Tom will&#8211;or get himself removed. He ain&#8217;t
nobody&#8217;s fool&#8211;nor never was!&#8221; And he rested his eyes
significantly upon the Professor.</p>

<p>The Professor was busy, however. He had pulled a deck of cards from his hip
pocket, and now was riffling them with pointed interest. Directly he began to
deal them around, carefully overlooking the lean man as he did so. But the
latter, dropping over upon one elbow, permitted the game to proceed without
offering objection to the oversight, a peculiar one, since he was in the full
glare of the fire.</p>

<p>That argument was closed.</p>

<p>But next morning Pat received unexpected attention. His young master
approached him, looped a rope around his neck, and gave the end to the large
man, who mounted the white. Then the lean man bridled and saddled the sorrel for
the young man, who evidently was unable conveniently to do these things with his
one hand. After this he loaded Pat with the extra saddles and bridles, and thus
they set out. It was a not unfavorable change, and Pat, while harboring mixed
emotions, since he now was trailing along behind the white, yet found himself in
a lighter <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span> mood.
Feeling little jealousy of the white, however, he soon forgot the changed
relations, finding in his own position a new viewpoint upon the cavalcade which
was interesting. For now he could survey the whole squad, five horses of varied
size and action, and this, as he studied the individual gait of each, was not
without its pleasure. Also, being, as he was, free from the weight of a man, he
felt an airy lightness that was positively refreshing. And finally, since he was
out of reach of the nagging white, this blessing alone made him grateful. So he
followed along, working yet not working, with a feeling of complete composure
such as had not been his for many a day.</p>

<p>Still his composure did not last. The novelty wore off toward noon, and he
found himself morose and introspective again. Sounding the depths of his
grievances, he at length took to thinking of the white corral beside the river.
Not in many a day had he thought of the ranch. But he was recalling it now, not
through affection, not because it was home to him, but because, brooding over
his many discomforts in the open, he was suddenly remembering that his life had
not always been this&#8211;that he knew actual comfort, knew what it was to have
his wants gratified. And recalling these facts, he naturally recalled that which
had made them possible&#8211;the little ranch in the valley. So he let his
thoughts linger there. Faint and elusive at first, those other days became
finally quite vivid, days of expectancy and gratification, days of sugar and
quartered apples, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
days of affection and love-talk from his pretty little mistress. And how he
missed them all! How he missed them&#8211;even the Mexican hostler and the brown
saddler and the old matronly horse&#8211;his mother by adoption! But they were
gone from him now, gone for all time out of his life. Yet though he believed
them gone, he continued to brood on them, to live each day over again in his
thoughts, till the men ahead dismounted suddenly. Then he was glad to turn his
attention to other matters, things close around him. One of these was the coming
of the lean man with a pair of familiar objects in his hands&#8211;this after
the noonday meal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my bucky,&#8221; he began, turning critical eyes over Pat,
&#8220;I been studyin&#8217; your case a heap, and I&#8217;ve come to think
I&#8217;m old Doctor Sow himself. Your young man here is knocked out of all
possible good,&#8221; he went on, as Stephen smilingly approached, &#8220;and so
it occurred to me, sir, as how you ain&#8217;t sick no more&#8217;n I be. What
ails you is you&#8217;re an aristocrat&#8211;something that&#8217;s been knocked
around unusual&#8211;what with them rustlers and with us that&#8217;s worse than
rustlers&#8211;and got yourself all mussed up and unfit! All you need is a
cleanin&#8217;&#8211;that&#8217;s what ails you! You&#8217;re just nice
furniture&#8211;a piece o&#8217; Sheraton, mebbe&#8211;that&#8217;s all over
sweepings, and I&#8217;m the he-maid that&#8217;s going to dust you off. Hold
still, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Pat, after taking a step toward Stephen, who now was stroking him
tenderly, held very still, not only under the soothing caress, but under the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
operation&#8211;for such was the cleaning&#8211;since he was gritty beyond
belief. Also, after the operation he felt immeasurably better, and better still
when Stephen led him to a tiny stream and he had relieved his thirst. But that
was not all of joy. Turned loose with the other horses, he fell to grazing
eagerly, actually finding it good, and once lifting a long and shrill nicker in
gratitude for this change in his condition. Nor did his delight stop here. With
camp broken, and his young master, instead of returning him to the lead-rope,
bridling and saddling him awkwardly with one hand, he set out along the trail at
a gait so brisk that it brought a startled exclamation from the young man, who
promptly pulled him down. But though he was forced to keep a slow gait, yet
frequently during the afternoon, conscious of his fresh coat and the sense of
buoyancy it gave him, he flung up his head and nickered loud and joyfully. Also,
with night once more descending, and the stars twinkling in the blue-black
heavens, and the sheen of a rising moon flooding the desert, he moved about
among the other horses with a vigor that was almost insolence, seizing tufts of
grass wherever he saw them, heedless of others&#8217; rights.</p>

<p>Around the fire sat or sprawled the men. Two of them were industriously
mending, one a shirt, the other a bridle. The Professor and the man with the
scrubby beard were complacently smoking, while Stephen, glad to stretch out
after the day&#8217;s ride with an arm that constantly distressed <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span> him, was reclining upon
a blanket, staring into the flames and conjuring up in their leaping tongues
numerous soothing pictures. As he sat there the man with the beard suddenly
addressed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doc,&#8221; he drawled, removing his pipe from between whiskers that
glinted in the light of the fire, &#8220;now that you&#8217;ve got him, what are
you thinking of doing with that horse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take him back,&#8221; replied Stephen, pleasantly.</p>

<p>The other was silent. &#8220;Shore!&#8221; he rejoined, after a moment.
&#8220;But take him back where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where he belongs.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was further silence. &#8220;Excuse me!&#8221; finally exclaimed the
other. &#8220;I was thinking as mebbe you&#8217;d take him whence he
came.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stephen sat erect and looked at the other. He was smoking again
complacently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whence come you?&#8221; asked Stephen, after a time.</p>

<p>The other slowly removed his pipe. Then he told him. Then Stephen spoke. And
then the man rose stiffly, crossed solemnly to him and shook hands with him
cordially.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knowed you was white the fust day I see you,&#8221; he declared.
Then he waved a vague hand over the others. &#8220;They&#8217;ve all&#8211;all
of &#8217;em&#8211;traveled that way. I was raised&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>A sudden shrill scream out in the darkness interrupted him. It was a horse.
The cry stirred the entire camp. The Professor arose, sauntered out, whistling,
whirled, and called back sharply. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_221'></a>221</span> The others ran toward him; the large man struck a
match. The white horse was limping on three legs. They bent over and examined
the fourth. The match went out. All straightened up. As they did so Pat sounded
a shrill nicker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Busted!&#8221; exclaimed the large man, quietly. &#8220;Well,
I&#8217;m a goat! That black horse has kicked old Tom clear over the divide.
I&#8211;I&#8217;m clean done! Quick as lightning, too! No preambles; no
circumlocutions; no nothing. Just put it to him. Good Lord!&#8221; Then he
regretfully drew a revolver. &#8220;I reckon you boys better stand
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>A shot broke the quiet, and the desert shivered and was still again. The
white horse sank to the ground. Stephen walked to Pat, struck a match, and
looked him over critically. Pat was torn and bleeding in two places along the
neck, but otherwise he needed no attention. Stephen patted him thoughtfully,
gratefully, fighting the horror of what might have been had this splendid horse
weakened in the crisis. No wonder the little girl in the valley worshiped
him.</p>

<p>But he said nothing. After a time he returned to the fire and sat down among
a very sober group of men. Presently the man with the scrubby beard broke the
quiet. His voice sounded hollow and distressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knowed it,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;Though I thought old Tom
&#8217;u&#8217;d done better.&#8221; He began to roll a cigarette. &#8220;Pore old
Tom! He&#8217;s killed; he&#8217;s dead&#8211;dead and gone.&#8221; With the
cigarette made, he snatched a brand from the fire and lighted <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span> it. He fell to smoking
in thoughtful silence, in his eyes a look of unutterable sadness.</p>

<p>The Professor bestirred himself. &#8220;Tell me,&#8221; he asked, lifting his
gaze to the heavens reflectively&#8211;&#8220;tell me, does any of you believe
that horses&#8211;any animiles&#8211;has souls?&#8221;</p>

<p>The lean man glanced at him. His eyes now had the look of one anxious to
express his views, but cautiously refused to be baited. Finally he made
answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re askin&#8217; my opinion,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you that I know they have.&#8221; He was silent. &#8220;I
know that animals has the same thing we&#8217;ve got,&#8221; he
continued&#8211;&#8220;that thing we call the soul&#8211;but they&#8217;ve got
it in smaller proportions, so to speak. It&#8217;s easy as falling off a bucking
bronc. Take old Tom out there. Take that Lady horse that got killed two years
ago by rustlers&#8211;take any horse, any dumb animal&#8211;and I&#8217;ll show
you in fifteen different ways that they&#8217;ve got souls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>The lean man glared. &#8220;Now &#8216;how&#8217;!&#8221; he snapped. &#8220;You
give me a mortal pang. Why don&#8217;t you never use your eyes once like other
and more decent folks? Get the habit. You&#8217;ll see there ain&#8217;t any
difference between animals and humans, only speech, and they&#8217;ve got
that!&#8221;</p>

<p>The large man smiled. &#8220;Let&#8217;s have it, Bob,&#8221; he invited.
&#8220;Where&#8217;ll we look for it first?&#8221;</p>

<p>The lean man showed an impatience born of contempt. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he
began, tossing away his cigarette, &#8220;in desires, first, then in their power
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span> to appreciate,
and, finally, in their sense of the worth of things. They have that, and
don&#8217;t you think they hain&#8217;t. But they&#8217;ve got the others, too.
Animals like to eat and drink and play, don&#8217;t they? You know that! And
they understand when you&#8217;re good to &#8217;em and when you&#8217;re cussed
mean. You know that. And they know death when they see it, take it from me,
because they&#8217;re as sensitive to loss of motion, or breathing, or animal
heat, as us humans&#8211;more so. They feel pain, for instance, more&#8217;n we
do, because, lackin&#8217; one of the five&#8211;or six, if you
like&#8211;senses, their other senses is keyed up higher&#8217;n our&#8217;n.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Professor looked belligerent. &#8220;Get particular!&#8221; he
demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t get particular,&#8221; snapped the other. &#8220;S&#8217;pose
you wrastle it out for yourself&#8211;same as us humans.&#8221; Evidently he was
still bitter against this man. &#8220;That Lady horse o&#8217; mine,&#8221; he
went on, his eyes twinkling, addressing himself to the others, &#8220;she had it
all sized about right. She used to say to me, when I&#8217;d come close to her
in the morning: &#8216;Well, old sock,&#8217; she&#8217;d say, throwin&#8217; her old
ears forward, &#8216;how are you this mornin&#8217;?&#8211;You know,&#8217;
she&#8217;d declare, &#8216;I kind o&#8217; like you because you understand me.&#8217;
Then she&#8217;d about wipe her nose on me and go on. &#8216;Wonder why it is that so
many of you don&#8217;t! It&#8217;s easy enough, our language,&#8217;
she&#8217;d p&#8217;int out, &#8216;but most o&#8217; you two-legged critters
don&#8217;t seem to get us. It&#8217;s right funny! You appear to get &#8217;most
everything else&#8211;houses, and land, and playin&#8217;-cards, and <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span> sich. But you
don&#8217;t never seem to get us&#8211;that is, most o&#8217; you! Why,
&#8217;tain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; but sign language, neither&#8211;same as Injuns
talkin&#8217; to whites. But I reckon you&#8217;re idiots, most o&#8217; you,
and blind, you hairless animals, wearin&#8217; stuff stole offen sheep, and your
ugly white faces mostly smooth. You got the idee we don&#8217;t know
nothin&#8217;&#8211;pity us, I s&#8217;pose, because we can&#8217;t understand you.
Lawzee! We understand you, all right. It&#8217;s you &#8217;at don&#8217;t understand
us. And that&#8217;s the hull trouble. You think we&#8217;re just a lump
o&#8217; common dirt, with a little tincture o&#8217; movement added, just
enough so as we can run and drag your loads around for you. Wisht you could
&#8217;a&#8217; heard me and old Tom last night, after you&#8217;d all turned
in, talkin&#8217; on the subject o&#8217; keepin&#8217; well and strong and
serene o&#8217; mind. Sign language? Some. But what of it, old whiskers?
Don&#8217;t every deef-and-dumb party get along with few sounds and plenty of
signs? You humans give me mortal distress!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so on,&#8221; concluded this lover of animals. &#8220;Thus Lady
horse used to talk to me every mornin&#8217;, tryin&#8217; to make me see things
some little clearer. And that&#8217;s all animals&#8211;if you happen to know
the &#8216;try me&#8217; on their little old middle chamber work.&#8221; He fell
silent.</p>

<p>The others said nothing. Each sat smoking reflectively, gazing into the dying
flames, until one arose and prepared to turn in. Stephen was the last except the
Professor and the man with the scrubby beard. And finally the Professor <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span> gained his feet and,
with a glance at the last figure remaining at the fire, took off his boots and
rolled up in his blanket. For a long moment he stared curiously at the other
bowed in thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you goin&#8217; to turn in?&#8221; he finally inquired.
&#8220;You ain&#8217;t et up by nothin&#8217;, be you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The lean man slowly lifted his head. &#8220;I was thinkin&#8217;,&#8221; he
said, half to himself, &#8220;of a&#8211;a kind of horse&#8217;s prayer I once
see in a harness-shop in Albuquerque.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other twisted himself under his blanket. &#8220;How did it go?&#8221; he
asked, encouragingly. &#8220;Let&#8217;s all have it!&#8221;</p>

<p>The lean man arose. &#8220;&#8216;To thee, my master,&#8217; it started off,&#8221;
he began, moving slowly toward his blanket. Suddenly he paused. &#8220;I&#8211;I
don&#8217;t just seem to remember it all,&#8221; he said, and sat down and
pulled off one of his boots. He held it in his hands absently.</p>

<p>The Professor urged him on. &#8220;Let her come,&#8221; he said, his face now
hidden in the folds of his covering. &#8220;Shoot it&#8211;let&#8217;s
hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;To thee, my master, I offer my prayer,&#8217;&#8221; presently
continued the other, turning reflective eyes toward the flickering coals.
&#8220;&#8216;Feed me, water me, care for me, and, when the&#8211;the day&#8217;s work
is done, provide me with shelter and a clean, dry bed, and, when you can, a
stall wide enough for me to lie down in in comfort. Always be kind to me. Talk
to me&#8211;your voice often means as much to me as the reins. Pet me sometimes,
that I may serve you the more gladly and know <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_226'></a>226</span> that my services are appreciated, and that I may
learn to love you. Do not jerk the reins, and do not whip me when going up-hill.
And when I don&#8217;t understand you, what you want, do not strike or beat or
kick me, but give me a chance to understand you. And if I continue to fail to
understand, see if something is not wrong with my harness or
feet.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The Professor&#8217;s blanket stirred. &#8220;Go on!&#8221; he yelled.
&#8220;Sounds all right. Go ahead! Is that all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I disremember the rest,&#8221; replied the other. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
see!&#8221; He was silent. &#8220;No,&#8221; he finally blurted out, &#8220;I
can&#8217;t get it. It says something about overloading, and a-hitching where
water don&#8217;t drop on him, and&#8211;Oh yes! &#8216;I can&#8217;t tell you when
I&#8217;m thirsty,&#8217; it goes on, &#8216;so give me cool, clean water often. Never
put a frosty bit in my mouth; first warm it by holdin&#8217; it a moment in your
hands. And, remember, I try to carry you and your burdens without a murmur, and
I wait patiently for you long hours of the day and night. Without power to
choose my shoes or path, I sometimes stumble and fall, but I stand always in
readiness at any moment to lose my life in your service. And this is important,
and, finally, O my master! when my useful strength is gone do not turn me out to
starve, or sell me to some cruel owner to be slowly tortured and starved to
death; but do thou, my master, take my life in the kindest way, and your God
will reward you here and hereafter. You will not consider me <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span> irreverent, I know, if I
ask all this in the name of Him Who was born in a stable.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The Professor&#8217;s blanket stirred again. &#8220;Go on,&#8221; he demanded
in muffled tones. &#8220;Is that all?&#8221;</p>

<p>The lean man slipped off his second boot. &#8220;No,&#8221; he replied,
quietly, &#8220;that ain&#8217;t all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, go ahead. It&#8217;s good. That horse must &#8217;a&#8217; been
a city horse; but go on!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only one more word, anyway,&#8221; was the rejoinder. He was still
holding his boot.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8221;&#8211;the voice was solemn&#8211;&#8220;it&#8217;s
&#8216;Amen.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, shucks!&#8221; came from the depths of the blanket.</p>

<p>The lean man turned his head. &#8220;Say, you!&#8221; he rasped,
belligerently.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>For answer the boot sailed across the camp.</p>

<p>The Professor popped his head out of the blanket, drew it back suddenly,
popped it out again, all strongly suggestive of a turtle.</p>

<p>There was a hoarse laugh, then silence, but none of those men forgot the
Prayer of the Horse.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span><a id='link_19'></a>CHAPTER XIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>ANOTHER CHANGE OF MASTERS</span></h2>

<p>The next morning Pat had a change from the tedium of the desert. With the
others he struck into a narrow canyon that led out to a beaten trail upon a
rolling mesa. The trail wound diagonally across the mesa from the south and lost
itself in snake-like twistings among hills to the north. Guided to the right
into this trail, Pat found himself, a little before noon, in a tiny Mexican
settlement. It was a squat hamlet, nestling comfortably among the hills, made up
of a few adobes, a lone well, and a general store. The store was at the far end,
and toward this his young master directed him.</p>

<p>As they rode on Pat noticed a queer commotion. Here and there a door closed
violently, only to open again cautiously as they drew opposite, revealing
sometimes two, sometimes three, sometimes five pairs of black eyes, all ranged
timidly one pair over another in the opening. Dogs skulked before their
approach, snarling in strange savagery, while whole flocks of chickens, ruffling
in dusty hollows, took frantically to wing at their coming, fleeing before them
in unwonted <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
disorder. And finally, as they moved past the well, a half-grown boy, only
partly dressed, hurtled out of the side door of one house, raced across a yard
to the front door of another house, and slammed the door shut behind him in a
panic.</p>

<p>It was all very strange, and it made a deep impression upon him. Also it
evidently impressed the men, for as they drew rein in front of the store, with
its dust-dry shelves and haunting silence, all asked quick questions of the
proprietor, a little wizened, gimlet-eyed Mexican who was leaning in the
doorway. After glancing over their accoutrements with a nod of understanding, he
answered, explaining the reason for the agitation.</p>

<p>It was all the result of a raid. Three days before a band of marauders had
swept down from the north, ransacked pigstys and chicken-coops and corrals, and
galloped off madly to the south. Yes, they had plundered the store also. Indian
renegades&#8211;yes. He could not say from what reservation. Yes, they were
armed, and in warpaint, and riding good horses&#8211;all of them. No, he could
not say&#8211;about thirty in the band, perhaps. He&#8211;What? Yes, he had
alfalfa and, if they wished, other things&#8211;beans and rice and canned goods.
No, the renegades had not wholly cleaned out the store. Yes, he had matches. No,
they had not&#8211; What? <i>Vino?</i> To be sure he had <i>Vino</i>! He would
get&#8211;how many bottles?&#8211;right away! It was in the cellar, where he
kept it cool, and reasonably safe from all marauders&#8211;including <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span> himself. With this
slight witticism he disappeared into the store.</p>

<p>The men dismounted. They sat down upon the porch, and one of them, the large
man, removed his hat, produced a blue bandana, and fell to mopping his red face.
The day was warm, and the settlement, lying low under surrounding peaks,
received none of the outside breezes. Also, it was inert now, wrapped in the
quiet of a frightened people. There was no movement anywhere save that of
ruffling hens in the dust of the trail, and the nearer switching of
horses&#8217; tails. Once this stillness was broken. Among the houses somewhere
rose feminine lamentations, wailing sobs, the outburst cutting the quiet with a
sharpness that caused the men to turn grave eyes in its direction. And now the
keeper of the store reappeared, bearing three bottles of wine in his arms, and
numerous supplies, which the men accepted and paid for. Then all led their
horses back to the well, which was in a little clearing, and there prepared to
make camp, throwing off saddle-bags and accoutrements and building a fire while
they planned a real meal.</p>

<p>Pat was enjoying all this. The settlement had a faintly familiar look, and he
half expected to see a swarthy Mexican, whip in hand, approach him with abusive
tongue. Also, after weeks of far horizons and unending sweeps of desert, he
found in this nearness of detail pleasurable relief. It was good to see
something upright again without straining across miles of desolation, even <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span> as it was good to see
adobes once more, with windows and doors, and smoke curling up out of chimneys.
He felt a deep sense of security, of coziness, which he had been fast losing on
the broad reaches, together with his sight for short distances. For his eyes had
become affected since leaving the white corral beside the river, although with
this he was aware of a peculiar gain. His sense of hearing now was most acute,
and he could hear the least faint sounds&#8211;sounds which, before his taking
to the open, he could not have heard. So he was enjoying it all, feeling real
comfort, a kind of fitness, as if he belonged here and would better remain here
for ever. Then, with a generous supply of alfalfa tossed to him, as to the other
horses, he became convinced that he should remain in this little settlement for
all time.</p>

<p>Along in the afternoon the storekeeper, accompanied by a native woman, who
was tear-stained and weeping, crossed the settlement. At the moment the men,
lounging about on blankets, were discussing ways and means for Stephen. He need
not continue with them now, they informed him, unless he wanted to. Arrangements
could be made here to get him to a railroad in some kind of vehicle, leading Pat
behind. But it was up to him. They weren&#8217;t hurrying him away, by any
means, yet it sure was up to him to get proper treatment for his arm, which
showed slow signs of recovery.</p>

<p>Stephen was considering this when the two <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_232'></a>232</span> Mexicans approached. The proprietor of the store
started to explain, when the little woman draped in a black mantilla interrupted
him with further sobbing and a pointing finger&#8211;pointing back across the
settlement.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Caballeros</i>,&#8221; she began, &#8220;you coom please wit&#8217;
me, I&#8211;I haf show you soomt&#8217;ing.&#8221; Then again she burst into
weeping.</p>

<p>Startled, Stephen arose, and the others gained their feet. They set out
across the settlement. They struck between some adobe houses, crossed some back
yards, dodged under clothes-lines, and found themselves in a tiny graveyard. The
woman brought them to a stop before a fresh mound of earth. Here she knelt in
another outburst of tears, while the gimlet-eyed storekeeper explained.</p>

<p>It was a little boy twelve years old. The marauders had stolen his pig. He
had bitterly denounced them, and one&#8211;evidently the leader&#8211;had shot
him. It was too bad! But it was not all. In one of the houses, the large house
they had passed in coming here, lay an old man, seventy-eight years of age,
dying from a rifle-shot. Yes, the renegade Indians had shot him also. What had
he done? He had defended his chickens against theft. It was too bad! It was all
too bad! Could not there something be done? To live in peace, to live in strict
accord with all known laws, such was the aim and such had been the conduct of
these people. And then to have a band of cutthroats, murderers, thieves, descend
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span> upon their peace
and quiet in this fashion! It was all too bad!</p>

<p>The rangers turned away from the scene. All save the woman set out across the
settlement, returning to the camp in silence. Seated once more, they fell to
discussing this situation. And discussing the tragedy, they reverted to Stephen
and his own troubles, light in comparison. They themselves, they acknowledged,
had their work all cut out for them. It was what they got their money for. But
there was hardly any use, they pointed out, in Stephen&#8217;s accompanying them
on this mission. Yet he could go if he wanted to. What did he say?</p>

<p>And Stephen, gazing off thoughtfully toward the tiny mound of fresh earth,
and seeing the little woman prostrated with grief upon the grave, knew that
Helen, herself bitter with loss, and no doubt needing Pat as much almost as this
woman needed her own lost one, would have him do what he wanted to do. And what
he wanted to do, felt as if he must do, was to accompany these men, go with
them, disabled though he was, and help as best he could to bring down
retribution upon the renegades. And he made known his wishes to the others,
finally, expressing them with a note of determination.</p>

<p>As they bridled and saddled, leaving all equipment not actually required, the
proprietor of the store, his small eyes eager, stood close and frequently
repeated his opinion that murder in even more gruesome form had been committed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span> to the north. Then
they set out, following the direction taken by the Indians, riding briskly,
keyed up to energy through hope of encounter, although Stephen suffered not a
little from the jolting of his arm. Dropping down from the hills, they swung out
upon the mesa, and thence made into the south along a winding trail. Ordinarily
they would have lingered to accept the strained hospitality of the settlement.
But this was duty, duty large and grave, and, conscious of it all, they pressed
forward in silence. The renegades&#8217; tracks stood out clearly, and the
rangers noted that some of the horses were shod, others only half shod, while
the greater number were without shoes at all. This told of the marauders&#8217;
nondescript collection of mounts, and also acquainted them with the fact that
many of the animals had been stolen. On through the afternoon they rode, making
but little gain, since the tracks became no fresher. When darkness fell, though
still in the open without protection of any kind save that offered by a slight
rise of ground, they dismounted and prepared to make camp.</p>

<p>Throughout the afternoon Pat had felt something of the grim nature of this
business. This not only because of the severe crowding which he had
endured&#8211;though that had told him much&#8211;but because of the unwonted
silence upon the men. So he had held himself keenly to the stride, rather liking
its vigor after long days of walking, finding himself especially fit to meet it
after his recent change of food. And although the sun <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span> had been swelteringly hot, yet the
desert had been swept with counteracting breezes, and, with night finally
descending, he had felt more than ever his fine mettle, and now, even though his
master was painfully dismounting, he felt fit to run his legs off at the least
suggestion.</p>

<p>This fitness remained with him. When his young master turned him loose at the
end of a generous tether, he stepped eagerly away from the firelight and out
into the light of a rising moon, not to graze, for he felt no desire to graze,
having eaten his fill and more at noon, but to give vent to his high spirits in
unusual rolling in the sands. This he quickly proceeded to do, kicking and
thrashing about, and holding to it long after the men about the fire had ceased
to come and go in preparing their meal, long after they had seated themselves in
the cheerful glow, smoking and talking as was their habit.</p>

<p>The Professor noticed it. He looked at the man with the beard pointedly.
&#8220;That Pat hoss he&#8217;s workin&#8217; up another job o&#8217;
cleanin&#8217; for you,&#8221; he observed. &#8220;Seemed in an awful hurry,
too,&#8221; he added, then dropped his eyes innocently.</p>

<p>The other was punching new holes in his belt with an unwieldy jack-knife. He
suddenly gave off twisting the point of the knife against the leather and lifted
it menacingly in the direction of his tormentor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look-a-here, Professor,&#8221; he retorted, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t
feelin&#8217; any too pert right now, and I&#8217;ll take a hop out o&#8217; you
if you don&#8217;t shet up!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>The Professor
looked grieved. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter of you?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never you mind!&#8221; The knife went back to the leather again.
&#8220;Let that horse roll if he wants to! It ain&#8217;t any skin off your
hands!&#8221;</p>

<p>Which was the key-note of all assembled save the Professor. All except him
appeared tense and nervous and in no way inclined to joke. For a time after the
lean man&#8217;s rebuke they engaged in casual talk, then one after another they
drew off their boots and rolled up in their blankets. All but Stephen. His arm
was throbbing with unusual pain. It was still in splints, and still bandaged in
a sling around his neck, and since it always hurt him to change positions, he
remained seated beside the fire, wrapped in sober thought. Outside, in the
green-white light of the moon, he heard the horses one by one sink to rest.
Around him the desert, gripped in death-stillness, pressed close, while overhead
the star-sprinkled dome of heaven, unclouded, arched in all its wonted
glittering majesty. A long time he sat there, keenly alive to these things, yet
thinking strange thoughts, thoughts of his loneliness, and what might have been,
and where he might have been, had he never met the girl. These were new
thoughts, and he presently arose to rid himself of them and turned in, and soon
was in a doze.</p>

<p>Some time later, he did not know how much later, he was aroused by a sound as
of distant thunder. But as he lifted his head the sound disappeared. Yet when he
dropped his head back <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_237'></a>237</span> again he heard it. He pressed his left ear close to
earth. The sound grew louder and seemed to come nearer. Again he lifted his
head. As before, he could hear nothing save the snoring of the large man and the
dream-twitching of the Professor. He gazed about him. The camp was still. He
peered outside in the moonlight. The horses were all down&#8211;at rest. At
length he dropped back once more, closed his eyes sleepily, and soon dozed a
second time.</p>

<p>But again he was aroused. He whipped up his head. The sound was thundering in
his ears. He heard trampling hoofs&#8211;many hoofs&#8211;immediately outside.
He leaped to his feet. He saw horsemen&#8211;Indians&#8211;the
renegades&#8211;crowding past, riding frantically to the north. He called
sharply to the others, who were already waking and leaping to their feet. He
turned to the horses. They were all there, standing now, alert and tense.
Wheeling, he stared after the Indians. They were speeding away like the wind,
close huddled, fleeing in a panic. He watched them, dazed, saw them ascend a
rise, become a vacillating speck in the moonlight, and drop from view in a
hollow beyond the rise. He turned to the men. All stood in mute helplessness,
only half comprehending. He opened his mouth to speak, but as he did so there
came a sudden interruption.</p>

<p>It was a bugle-call, rollicking across the desert, crashing into the
death-like hush which had settled upon the camp. He turned his eyes toward the
sound&#8211;to the south. Over a giant sand-dune, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span> riding grouped, with one or two in the
lead, swept a company of cavalrymen. Down the slope they galloped, moonlight
playing freely upon them, bringing out every detail&#8211;the glint of arms, the
movement of hat-brims, the lift and fall of elbows&#8211;pounding straight for
the camp. Another blast of the bugle, crisp and metallic, and they swerved; they
drew near, nearer still, came close on the right, and swept past in a whirlwind
of sounds, thundering hoofs, cursing men, slamming carbines, creaking saddles,
snorting horses. So they swept on into the north, pushing, crowding, jostling,
throwing back flying gravel, odors of sweat, swirling dust-clouds. They mounted
rapidly over the rise, and became, as the pursued, vacillating specks, and then
disappeared in the hollow beyond.</p>

<p>Stephen recovered himself. He swept his eyes again over the horses. He saw a
change among them. Three were calm, but not the other two. Both of them were
weaving faintly, and, even as he sprang to them, one sank slowly to the ground.
Wondering, dazed, gripped in apprehension, he bent over it. The horse was a
stranger, and it was gasping its last breath. Dismayed, he turned to the other.
This horse also was a strange horse, and it was white with foam and panting,
also run to death. Astonished, cold with apprehension, he looked for Pat. But
neither Pat nor the sorrel was to be seen. Then the truth overwhelmed him. The
renegades, seeing fresh horses here, had made a swift change. Pat was gone!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>For one tense
moment he stood spellbound. Then he sprang into action. He dressed as best he
could, called to the others to bridle and saddle a horse, and leaped into the
saddle. His whole body rebelled at the movement. But he set his jaw grimly, and,
clutching at his bandaged arm, yet keeping his grip on the reins, he spurred
frantically after the cavalry. As he dashed away he shouted back his
purpose.</p>

<p>But the men, standing with wide eyes turned after him, heard only the
end:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get him in spite of hell!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span><a id='link_20'></a>CHAPTER XX<br /><span class='h2fs'>FIDELITY</span></h2>

<p>Meantime Pat was running at top speed across the desert. Yet he was trying to
understand this strange call to duty. Roused from fitful slumber by trampling
hoofs, he had felt an excited hand jerking him to his feet, and after that a
slender rope looped round his lower jaw. Then he had been urged, with a
wriggling form on his bare back, frantic heels drumming his sides, and a strange
voice impelling him onward past a surging crowd of horsemen, still only half
awake, out into the open. When he was well in the fore, he had found himself
crowded to his utmost&#8211;over sand-dune, into arroyo, across the
level&#8211;around him thundering hoofs, panting horses, silent men, all
speeding forward in the glorious moonlight. It was a strange awakening, yet he
had not entertained thoughts of rebellion, despite the fact that he had not
liked the flaying rope, the soft digging heels, the absence of bridle and
saddle. It was strange; it was not right. None of it had checked up with any
item of his experience. Yet, oddly enough, he had not rebelled.</p>

<p>Nor was he harboring thoughts of rebellion now. <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span> Racing onward, smarting with each swing
of the lash, he found himself somehow interested solely in holding his own with
the other horses. Suddenly, alert to their movements, he saw a cleft open in
their surging ranks, made by the fall of an exhausted horse. Yet the others did
not stop. They galloped on, unheeding, though he himself was jerked up. Then
followed a swift exchange of words, and then the unhorsed man mounted behind
Pat&#8217;s new master. Carrying a double load now, Pat nevertheless dashed
ahead at his former speed, stumbling with his first steps, but soon regaining
his stride and overtaking the others. And though it cost him straining effort,
he felt rewarded for his pains when one of the men uttered a grunt which he
interpreted as approval. But it was all very strange.</p>

<p>A canyon loomed up on his left. He had hardly seen the black opening when he
was swung toward it. He plunged forward with the other horses, and was the first
to enter the canyon&#8217;s yawning mouth. Between its high walls, however, he
found himself troubled by black shadows. Many of them reached across his path
like projections of rock, and more than once he faltered in his stride. But
after passing through two or three in safety he came at length to understand
them and so returned to his wonted self-possession.</p>

<p>But he was laboring heavily now. His heart was jumping and pounding, his
breath coming in gasps, but he held to the trail, moving ever deeper into the
hills, until he burst into a basin out of <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_242'></a>242</span> which to the right led a narrow canyon. Then he
slowed down and, turning into the canyon, which wound and twisted due north and
south in the bright moonlight, he continued at a slower pace. But his heart no
longer was in the task. The weight on his back seemed heavier; there was a
painful swelling of his ankles. He knew the reason for this pain. It had come
from unwonted contact with hard surfaces and frequent stepping on loose stones
in this strange haste with a strange people in the hills. Yet he kept on,
growing steadily more weary, yet with pride ever to the fore, until a faint
light began to streak the overhead sky, stealing cautiously down the ragged
walls of the canyon. Then he found himself pulled into a walk.</p>

<p>He was facing a narrow defile that wound up among the overhanging crags. Glad
of the privilege of resting, for a walk was a rest with him now, he set forward
into the uninviting pass. Up and up he clambered, crowding narrowly past
boulders, rounding on slender ledges, up and ever up. As he ascended he saw
gray-white vales below, felt the stimulus of a rarer air, and at last found his
heart fluttering unpleasantly in the higher altitude. Yet he held grimly to his
task, and, when broad daylight was streaming full upon him, he found himself on
a wide shelf of rock, a ledge falling sheer on one side to unseen depths,
towering on the other to awe-inspiring heights. Here he came to a halt. And
then, so tired was he, so faint with exhaustion, so racked of body and spirit,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span> that he sank upon
the cool rock even before the men could clear themselves from him, and lay there
on his side, his eyes closed, his lungs greedily sucking air.</p>

<p>The glare of full daylight aroused him. Regaining his feet, he stared about
him. He saw many strange-looking men, and near them many dirty and bedraggled
horses. He turned his eyes outward from the ledge. He saw around him bristling
peaks, and below them, far below, a trailing canyon, winding in and out among
hills toward the rising sun, and terminating in a giant V, beyond which, a
connecting thread between its sloping sides, lay an expanse of rolling mesa. It
was far from him, however&#8211;very, very far&#8211;and he grew dizzy at the
view, finding himself more and more unnerved by the height. At length he turned
away and swept his eyes again over the horses, where he was glad to find the
rangy sorrel. Then he turned back to the men, some of whom were standing, others
squatting, but all in moody silence.</p>

<p>As he looked he grew aware that a pair of dark eyes were fixed upon him. He
stared back, noting the man&#8217;s long hair and painted features and the
familiar glow of admiration in his eyes. Believing him to be his new master, he
continued to regard him soberly until the man, with a grunt and a grimace, rose
and approached him. Pat stood very still under a rigid examination. The man
rubbed his ankles, turned up his hoofs, looked at his teeth; and at the
conclusion of all this Pat felt <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_244'></a>244</span> that he had met with approval. Also, he realized
that he rather approved of the man. Then came a volley of sounds he did not
understand, and he found himself touched with grave apprehension. But not for
long. The man led him across the ledge to a tiny stream trickling down the
rocks, walking with a quiet dignity he long since had learned to connect with
kindliness. This and the fact that he led him to water determined his
attitude.</p>

<p>Toward noon, as he was brooding over hunger pangs, he was startled by excited
gutturals among the men. Gazing, he saw one of the men standing on the edge of
the shelf, pointing out through the long canyon. With the others, Pat turned his
eyes that way. Between the distant V dotting the mesa beyond rode a body of
horsemen. They were not more than specks to his eyes, proceeding slowly, so
slowly, in fact, that while he could see they were moving he yet could not see
them move as they crawled across the span between the canyon&#8217;s mouth.
Interested, gripped in the contagion of the excitement round him, he kept his
eyes upon the distant specks until the sun had changed to another angle. But
even after this lapse of time, so distant were the horsemen, so wide the
canyon&#8217;s mouth, they had traveled only half-way across the span. Yet he
continued to watch, wondering at the nervousness around him, conscious of
steadily increasing heat upon him, until the last of the slow-moving specks,
absorbed one by one by the canyon&#8217;s wall, disappeared <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span> from view. Then he turned his eyes
elsewhere.</p>

<p>The men also turned away, but continued their excited talk. But even they
after a time relapsed into silence. What it was all about Pat did not know. He
knew it was something very serious, and suddenly fear came to him. He saw some
of the men lie down as if to sleep, and he feared that they intended to remain
here for ever, in this place absolutely destitute of herbage. But after a time,
made sluggish by the attitude of the men, he himself attempted to drowse. But
the heat pulsating up off the rocks discouraged him, and he soon abandoned the
attempt, standing motionless in the hot sun.</p>

<p>A change came over him. He took to brooding over his many
discomforts&#8211;hunger pangs, loss of sleep, bothersome flies, the pain of his
swollen ankles. As the day advanced his ankles swelled more, and grew worse, the
flies became more troublesome, and his inner gnawings more pronounced. So the
time went on and he brooded through the still watches of the afternoon, through
the soft stirrings of evening, on into night again. With the coming of night
light breezes rose from the spaces below to spur his fevered body into something
of its wonted vigor. And the night brought also preparations among the men to
journey on. This he welcomed, even more than the cooling zephyrs.</p>

<p>There was some delay. His master entered upon a dispute with the horseless
man. The <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span> voices
became excited and rose to vehement heights. But presently they subsided when
Pat himself, anxious to be active, sounded a note of protest. Yet the argument
proved to his benefit. Instead of mounting him behind his master, the odd man
swung up behind another man on the sorrel. Then he was permitted to move
forward, and as he approached the narrow defile he sounded another nicker, now
of gratification.</p>

<p>The pass dropped almost sheer in places. As he descended, more than once he
was compelled to slide on stiffened legs. In this at first he felt ecstatic
danger thrills. But only at first. Soon he wearied of it, and he was glad when
he struck the bottom, where, after being guided out of shadow and into broad
moonlight, he found himself moving to the west in a deep canyon. With the other
horses he burst into a canter, and continued at a canter hour after hour,
following the winding and twisting canyon until daylight, with its shadows
creeping away before him, revealed to his tired eyes a stretch of mesa ahead,
dotted with inviting clumps of bunch-grass. Then of his own volition he came to
a stop and fell to grazing. Soon all the horses were standing with mouths to
earth, feeding eagerly.</p>

<p>The men, sitting for a time in quiet conversation, finally dismounted,
laughing now and then, and casting amused glances toward the black horse.</p>

<p>Soon they mounted again to take the trail. Instead of riding with the other
on the sorrel, the odd man swung up on Pat&#8217;s back behind his <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span> master. But as Pat no
longer suffered from hunger, he complacently accepted the return of the double
load. Then all moved forward. Pat jogged out of the canyon, turning to the right
on the desert, and moved rapidly north in the shadow of the hills. He held to
his stride, and toward noon, rounding a giant ridge projecting into the desert
from the hills, he saw ahead on his right, perhaps two miles distant across a
basin, the mouth of another canyon. Evidently his master saw it also, and
obviously it contained danger, for he jerked Pat down to a walk. Almost
instantly he knew that the danger was real, for the man, sounding a sharp
command to the others, brought him to a full stop. Then followed an excited
discussion, and, when it ended, Pat, gripped in vague uneasiness, found himself
urged forward at top speed. Yet in a dim way he knew what was wanted of him. He
flung himself into a long stride and dashed across the wide basin, across the
mouth of the canyon, into the shadow of the hills again. Breathless, he
slackened his pace with thirty excited horses around him, mad swirling clouds of
dust all about, and before him the oppressive stillness of the desert. They were
safely past the danger zone.</p>

<p>He pressed on at a slow canter. Ahead the mesa revealed numerous sand-dunes,
large and small, rising into the monotonous skyline. Plunging among them, he
mounted some easily, others he skirted as easily, and once, to avoid an
unusually large one, he dropped down into the bed of an <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span> arroyo, traveled along its dry course,
and then clambered up on the desert. But it was wearying work, and, becoming
ever more aware of his double load, he began to chafe with dissatisfaction. Yet
he held to his gait, hopeful of better things&#8211;he was always hopeful of
better things now&#8211;until he reached another dune, larger than any as yet
encountered, when once more he broke out of his stride to circle its bottom. As
he did so, of his own volition he checked himself. Dead ahead he saw horses
scattered about, and beyond the horses, rising limply in the noon haze, a thin
column of smoke. Also, he felt both his riders stiffen. Then on the midday hush
rose the crack of firearms from the direction of the camp.</p>

<p>His master lifted a shrill voice. He felt a mighty pull at his head. He swung
around like a flash. Then came the flaying of a rope and frantic urging of
heels. He plunged among the surging horses, dancing and whirling excitedly, and
out into the open beyond. He set his teeth grimly, and raced headlong to the
south, galloping furiously, tearing blindly over the desert. He headed straight
for the distant basin, straight for the mouth of the canyon, hurtling forward,
struggling mightily under his double load. He did not know it, but he was
speeding into a tragic crisis.</p>

<p>The others overtook him. They were carrying but single loads. But they did
not pass him. He saw to that. He burst forward into even greater speed, clung to
it grimly, forged into a position well in the lead. And he held this
place&#8211;around <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
him frenzied horses, frantic riders; behind him, to the distant rear, shot after
shot echoing over the desert; before him the baking sands, shimmering
heat-waves, sullen and silent. He raced on, swinging up over dunes, dropping
into hollows, speeding across flats, mounting over dunes again, on and on toward
the basin and the mouth of the canyon&#8211;and protection.</p>

<p>But again disaster.</p>

<p>Suddenly, out of the canyon poured the cheerful notes of a bugle. On the
vibrant wings of the echoes, streaming into the basin from the canyon, swept a
body of flying horsemen. Instantly he checked himself. Then his master sounded a
shrill outcry, swung his head around violently, and lashed him forward again. He
hurtled headlong, dashing toward the distant ridge, the peninsula jutting out
into the desert. Grimly he flung out along this new course. But he kept his eyes
to the left. He saw the horsemen there also swerve, saw them spread out like a
fan, and felt his interest kindle joyously. For this was a race! It was a race
for that ridge! And he must win! He must do this thing, for instinctively he
knew that beyond it lay safety. There he could flee to some haven, while cut off
from it, cut off by these steady-riding men on his left, he must submit to
wretched defeat. So he strained himself harder and burst into fresh speed,
finding himself surprised that he could. In the thrill of it he forgot his
double load, forgot the close-pressing horses, forgot irritating dust. On he
galloped, racing forward with <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_250'></a>250</span> machine-like evenness&#8211;on his left the
paralleling horsemen, to his rear yelling and shooting, on his right his own men
and horses, and for them he felt he must do big things.</p>

<p>Suddenly the shooting in his rear ceased. Evidently these men had received
some warning from the riders on his left. Then he awoke to another truth. The
horsemen on his left were gaining. It troubled him, and he cast measuring eyes
to the front. He saw that he was pursuing a shorter line to the ridge; he
believed he still could reach it first. So again he strained on, whipping his
legs into movement till they seemed about to snap. But the effort hurt him and
he discovered that he was becoming woefully tired. Also, the double weight
worried him. It had not become lighter with the miles, nor had he grown
stronger. Yet he galloped on with thundering hoofs, the tranquil desert before
him, the thud of carbines against leather to the left, behind him ominous
silence. But he kept his eyes steadily to the left, and presently he awoke to
something else there, something that roused him suddenly and in some way whipped
his conscience. For now he saw a white figure amid the khaki, racing along with
them&#8211;a part of them and yet no part of them&#8211;a familiar figure
wearing a familiar bandage. This for a brief moment only. Then he took to
measuring distances again; saw that the cavalrymen were holding to the course
steadily, racing furiously as he himself was racing for the ridge. Would he
win?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>A shrill outcry
from his master, and he found himself checked with a jerk. It was unexpected,
sudden, and he reared. The movement shook off the second man. Dropping back upon
all-fours, Pat awoke to the relief the loss of this load gave him. Grimly
determining to hold to this relief, he dashed ahead, following the guidance of
his master in yet another direction, hurtled away before the second man could
mount again.</p>

<p>He found that he was speeding in a direction almost opposite from the ridge.
He did not understand this. But his regret was not long lived. Casting his eyes
to his left in vague expectancy of seeing the familiar spot of white again, he
saw only his own men and horses, and beyond them the smiling desert. Puzzled, he
gazed to the right. Here he saw the cavalrymen, and though puzzled more, he yet
kept on with all his power. As he ran he suddenly awoke to the presence of a new
body of horsemen on his distant left, a smaller band than the cavalrymen, men
without uniforms, most of them hatless, all yelling. He remembered this yell,
and now he understood. He was speeding toward the mouth of the canyon; had been
turned completely around. And thus it was, he knew, that the horsemen once on
his left were now on his right, and the madly yelling group at his rear was now
on his left. He awoke to another realization. This was a race again, a race with
three new entrants now&#8211;all three making toward the canyon. Would he
win?</p>

<p>He fell to studying the flanking groups. On his <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span> right, riding easily, bent to the
winds, their heavy horses swinging rhythmically, their accoutrements rattling,
galloped the cavalry&#8211;steady, sure of themselves, well in hand. On his
left, riding furiously, without formation, dashed the smaller group of
riders&#8211;their horses wrangling among themselves, one or two frequently
bucking, all flinging forward in excited disorder. This disorder, this evident
nervousness, he feared. He knew somehow that the first real trouble would come
from this source. He knew men to that extent. And suddenly his fears were
realized. With the three converging lines of direction drawing closer, and the
mouth of the canyon but a short distance away, out of this group on his left
came a nasty rifle-fire, followed by a mighty chorus of yells. There was a
result at once. Close beside him a horse stumbled; the man astride the horse was
thrown headlong; from the cavalrymen on his right came a single shrill, piercing
outcry&#8211;a cry to desist! But he did not understand this. Nor did he heed
it. Galloping forward, eyes upon the ever-nearing canyon, he at length became
grimly conscious of approaching defeat&#8211;of the firm and ruthless closing in
upon him from either side of the two bands. And now, and not till now, realizing
as he did that the thing was beyond him, that he could not reach the canyon
first&#8211;now, and not till now, though soul and body were wrecked by
exhaustion, Pat abated his speed.</p>

<p>Instantly pandemonium broke loose. He heard <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_253'></a>253</span> the firing on his left increasing. He felt his
master make ready to return it. He saw others around him, twisting vengefully
into position, open with repeating rifles. Then the cavalrymen, evidently forced
into it by the others, swung to the fray with their carbines, which began to
boom on his right. The whole basin echoed and re-echoed sharp reports. Across
his eyes burst intermittent flames. His ears rang with shots and yells. The
shooting became heavier. Bullets sang close about him&#8211;seemed
centered&#8211;as if the enemy would cut down his master at once and disrupt the
others through his loss. The bullets sang closer still. And now immediately
about him men and horses dropped, upsetting other riders, tumbling over sound
horses&#8211;all in a seething chaos. He became dazed. His eyes were blinded
with the flashes, and his ears ached with the crash and tumult. He grew faint. A
dizziness seized him. But on he labored, his head aching, his eyes growing
dimmer, his limbs numb and rebellious, his heart thumping in sullen rebellion,
his ears bursting with the uproar.</p>

<p>Another change swept over him. Mist leaped before his eyes. The roaring in
his ears subsided. His legs flew off&#8211;he had no legs! The mist became a
film. Yet he could see&#8211;see faintly. He saw a mad jumble of flying men and
horses&#8211;a riotous mixture of color, arms, and firearms whirling and
interlaced, a grim, struggling mass in death-grips. It swept close&#8211;crashed
over him, struck him full. He felt the impact&#8211;then another. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span> The ground rose and
struck him. And now there fell upon him a great and wonderful peace&#8211;and a
blank&#8211;then a voice, a familiar voice, and he drifted into
unconsciousness.</p>

<p>He was wakened by a fiery liquid in his throat. He slowly opened his eyes. He
saw men and horses, many of them, standing or reclining in small groups. He saw
them between the legs of a group immediately around him&#8211;men gazing down at
him pitifully. As he lay thus dazed he heard the familiar voice again. It was
sounding his name. He struggled to his feet. Steadying himself against his
dizziness, he looked curiously at the young man standing before him. And
suddenly he recognized him. This was his young master with the white around his
arm and neck&#8211;the young man who had ridden him into the Mexican settlement,
and who had been so good to him there, giving him generous quantities of
alfalfa. He&#8211;But the voice was sounding again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You poor dumb brute!&#8221; said Stephen, quietly; and Pat liked the
petting he received. &#8220;You&#8217;ve just come through hell! But&#8211;but
if they get you again&#8211;anywhere, friend of mine&#8211;they&#8217;ll wade
through hell themselves to do it.&#8221; He was silent. &#8220;Pat, old
boy,&#8221; he concluded, finally, &#8220;you&#8217;re going back home!
I&#8211;I&#8217;m through!&#8221;</p>

<p>A strange thing took place in Pat. Hearing this voice now, and seeing the
owner of it, though he had seen him and heard his voice many times just before
this last heartbreaking task under a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_255'></a>255</span> strange master, he suddenly found himself thinking
of the little ranch beside the river, and of his loving mistress, and also the
cold and cruel Mexican hostler. And, thinking of them, he found himself thinking
also of another, one who had accompanied him and his mistress on many delightful
trips in the valley and up on the mesa in the shadow of the mountains. And now,
thinking of this person, he somehow recognized this young man before him fully,
and wondered why this had not come to him before. For this was the same young
man&#8211;curiously pale, curiously drawn and haggard&#8211;but yet the same
man. Understanding, understanding everything, he nickered softly and pressed
close, mindful of yet another thing&#8211;something that had helped to make his
life on the little ranch so pleasant and unforgettable. What he was mindful of,
and what he now sought, was sugar and quartered apples.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span><a id='link_21'></a>CHAPTER XXI<br /><span class='h2fs'>LIFE AND DEATH</span></h2>

<p>The third group in the affray consisted of cowboys. Weary and bedraggled, yet
joyous at the suppression of the uprising, they set out for home about noon.
Stephen, mounted upon Pat, accompanied them. They headed into the northwest,
riding slowly, talking over the affair, while Stephen explained in part his
interest in the black horse. Night found them near a water-hole, and here they
went into camp, Stephen weak and distressed, his whole body aching, his arm and
shoulder throbbing in agonizing pain. The men proved attentive and considerate;
but he lay down exhausted and courted sleep, hardly hearing what they said.
Sleep came to him only fitfully, and he was glad when break of day brought a
change. They rode on through the second day, usually in sober silence, on into
another dusk and another night of torture. A third day and a third dusk
followed, but there was no camp this time. Continuing forward, just before dawn,
with the moon brilliant in the heavens, they reached a cluster of buildings. One
of them was a dwelling with a fence around it as a protection against <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span> cattle and horses, and
to the rear of this all dismounted. Stephen led Pat into a spacious stable, and,
with the assistance of the others, unsaddled and unbridled him, watered and fed
him generously, then left him for the night.</p>

<p>Instantly Pat began to inquire into his condition and surroundings. He was
stiff and sore and a little nervous from the events of the past few days, and he
found the stable, spacious though it was, depressing after his protracted life
in the open. Yet there were many offsetting comforts. He had received a generous
supply of grain and all the water he could drink. Then there was another
comfort, though he awoke to this only after sinking to rest. His stall was
thickly bedded with straw, which was comfort indeed, and though he had become
accustomed to the pricking of the desert sand, he nestled into the straw with a
sigh of satisfaction. To his right and left other horses stirred restlessly, and
from outside came an occasional nicker, presumably from some unroofed inclosure.
All these sounds kept him awake for a time, and it was approaching day before he
felt himself sinking off into easy slumber.</p>

<p>He was awakened by the coming of a stranger into his stall. It was broad
daylight, and he hastily gained his feet, mystified for an instant that he
should be sleeping in broad day, and not a little troubled by his strange
surroundings. The new-comer was a fat youth with a round and smiling face, who,
as he raked down the bedding, talked in a pleasing drawl.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_258'></a>258</span>&#8220;Pat,&#8221; he began, shoving him over
gently, &#8220;you&#8217;re shore some cayuse. Wouldn&#8217;t mind ownin&#8217;
a piece o&#8217; you myself. But I was goin&#8217; for to say there&#8217;s
trouble come onto you. That mighty likable pardner o&#8217; yours is gone in
complete&#8211;sick to death. We&#8217;ve telephoned for the doc, but he&#8217;s
off somewheres, and we&#8217;ve got to wait till he gits back. But it&#8217;s
shore too bad&#8211;all of it. Steve he&#8217;s got a nasty arm and shoulder,
and he&#8217;s all gone generally. Mighty distressin&#8217; I call
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this he slapped Pat heartily and left him.</p>

<p>When he had gone Pat felt a depression creeping over him. It became heavier
as the hours passed. He knew that his young friend was somewhere about, and
could not understand why he failed to come to him himself, instead of sending
this stranger. Then, with the hours lengthening into a day, and the days
dragging into a week, with only the smiling stranger coming to him regularly,
and petting and stroking and talking to him, he came to feel that something of
grave and serious nature was going on outside. So he longed to get out of the
stable, out into sunlight and away from this restraint, and to see for himself
what it was that was holding his master from him.</p>

<p>Then late one afternoon he heard a step approaching. It was his
master&#8217;s step, yet it was very different. It was slow and dragging, and
while the voice was the same, yet there was a note of hollowness as he spoke
that did not belong there, a note as if it required great effort to speak <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span> at all. But in spite of
this he recognized his young master, and sounded a welcoming nicker, anxious to
be off. For somehow he believed that now he would be taken out into the
sunlight. Nor was he disappointed. After a moment&#8217;s petting the young man
led him outdoors, and there began to bridle and saddle him, slowly, with many
pauses for breath, all as if it hurt him, as indeed it must, since he still wore
the white bandages. Then there appeared a group of interested young men,
suddenly, as though they had just discovered the proposed departure.</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, Steve,&#8221; one of them exploded, &#8220;this ain&#8217;t
treating us a bit nice. You&#8217;re a mighty sick man. I ain&#8217;t saying
that to worry you, neither; but I can&#8217;t see the idee of your hopping out
of bed to do this thing. You stick around till the doc comes again, anyway. Now,
don&#8217;t be a fool, Steve.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stephen continued slowly with his saddling. &#8220;It&#8217;s decent of you
fellows,&#8221; he said, quietly. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t want you to think me
ungrateful. It&#8217;s just a feeling I&#8217;ve got. I want to get this horse
back where he belongs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another of the group took up the attempt at persuasion. &#8220;But
you&#8217;re sick, man!&#8221; he exclaimed, beginning to stroke Pat absently.
&#8220;You won&#8217;t never make the depot! You owe it to everybody
you&#8217;ve ever knowed to get right back into bed and stay there!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Stephen only shook his head. Yet he knew that what the boys said was
true. He was <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span> sick,
and he knew it. He realized that he ought to be in bed. And he wanted to be in
bed. But already he had suffered too much, lying inert, not because of his arm
and the fever upon him, though these were almost unbearable, but because of the
haunting fear, come to him ever more insistently with each passing day, that
since Pat had escaped from him twice thus far, he was destined to escape from
him a third time. Sometimes this fear took shape in visions of a blazing fire in
the stable, in which Pat was burned to a crisp; again it took form in some
malady peculiar to horses which would prove equally disastrous. At last, unable
to withstand these pictures longer, he had crept out of bed, dressed as best he
could, and stolen out of the house, bent upon getting Pat to the railroad, and
there shipping him east to Helen at whatever cost to himself. So here he was,
about to ride off.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re&#8211;you&#8217;re mighty decent,&#8221; he repeated,
hollowly, by way of farewell. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve got to go. And don&#8217;t
worry about my making the station,&#8221; he added, reassuringly. &#8220;I have
the directions, and I&#8217;ll get there in time to make that ten-thirty
eastbound to-night.&#8221; He clambered painfully up into the saddle.</p>

<p>A third member of the group, the round-faced and smiling cowpuncher, opened
up with his pleasing drawl. &#8220;Why&#8217;n&#8217;t you stay over till
mornin&#8217;, then?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;The ranch wagon goes up early,
and you could ride the seat just like a well man.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>But Stephen
remained obdurate, and, repeating his thanks and farewells, he urged Pat forward
at a walk because he himself could not stand the racking of a more rapid gait.
The men sent after him expressions of regret mingled with friendly
denunciations, but he rode steadily on, closing his ears grimly against their
pleas, and soon he was moving slowly across the Arizona desert. His direction
was northwest, and his destination, though new to him, a little town on the
Santa Fé.</p>

<p>As he rode forward through the quiet of the afternoon he found his thoughts a
curious conflict. At times he would think of the girl, and of his love for her,
and of the long, still hours spent in the ranch-house brooding, especially the
nights, when, gazing out at the stars, he had wondered whether she knew, or,
knowing, whether, after all, she really cared. They had been lonely nights,
fever-tossed and restless, nights sometimes curiously made up of
pictures&#8211;pictures of a runaway horse and of a girl mounted upon the horse,
and of long walks and rides and talks with her afterward, and of the last night
in her company, outside a corral and underneath a smiling moon, the girl in
white, her eyes burning with a strange glow, himself telling his love for her,
and hearing in return only that she did not and could not return that love.</p>

<p>These were his thoughts at times as he rode forward through the desert
solitude. Then he would awaken to his physical torture, and in this he would
completely forget his spiritual distress, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_262'></a>262</span> would ask why he had flung himself into this
mocking silence and plunged into all this misery and pain. He knew
why&#8211;knew it was because of the girl. But would it have been better to
accept her dismissal and, returning to the East, let her pass out of his memory?
In his heart he knew that he could not.</p>

<p>There followed the thought of his responsibility for Pat, and of what was
left for him to do. He recalled the theft, and his weeks of futile riding to
recover the horse, and the thrill accompanying risk of life when he finally
recovered him. And after that the second theft, and another and more dreadful
ride when he raced through the night after the cavalry&#8211;the torture of it,
the agony of his arm, the shooting, and the grappling hand to hand, and Pat
sinking with exhaustion, and the thrill again, his own, at having the horse once
more in his possession. It was <i>worth</i> it&#8211;all of it&#8211;and he was
<i>glad</i>&#8211;glad to have had an object for once in his life. And he still
had that object, for was he not riding the horse on a journey which would end in
placing Pat in the hands of the adorable girl who owned him?</p>

<p>Thus he rode through the afternoon and on into an early dusk. Suddenly
awaking to the Stygian darkness around him, he gave over thinking of the past
and future and turned uneasy thoughts upon the present. Above him was a black,
impenetrable dome, seemingly within touch of his hand; around and about him
pressed a dense wall that gave no hint of his whereabouts. <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span> Yet he believed that he was pursuing
the right direction; and, forgetting that Pat, no more than himself, knew the
route, he gave the horse loose rein. Thus for an hour, two hours, three, he rode
slowly forward, when like a flash it came to him that he was hopelessly lost. He
reined in the horse sharply.</p>

<p>For a time he sat trying to place himself. Failing in this, he raised his
eyes, hoping for a break in the skies. But there was no glimmer of light, and
after a while, not knowing what else to do, he sent Pat forward again. But his
uneasiness would not down, and presently he drew rein again, dismounted, and
fell to listening. There was not a breath of air. He took a step forward, his
uneasiness becoming fear, and again stood motionless, listening, gripped by the
oppressive stillness of the desert. It crept upon him, this death-quiet, seemed
to close about him suffocatingly. Suddenly he started. Out of the dense
blackness had come a voice, weak and plaintive. He turned tense with excitement
and listened keenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, there! This&#8211;over this way!&#8221;</p>

<p>He could see nothing; but he moved in the direction of the voice. After a few
strides he was stopped by a consciousness of something before him, and there was
a constrained groan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Careful, man&#8211;I&#8217;m hurt. Unhorsed this morning. Been
crawling all day for shade. Strike a match, will you? God! but it&#8217;s a
night!&#8221;</p>

<p>Stephen struck a light. As it flared up he saw prone in the sand a young man,
his face drawn <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span>
with pain, his eyes dark and hunted. The match went out. He struck another. The
man was pitifully bruised and broken. A leg of his trousers had been torn away,
and the limb lay exposed, strangely twisted. His track, made in crawling through
the sand, stood out clearly, trailing away beyond the circling glow of light. A
moment of flickering, and the second match went out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which way were you headed, friend?&#8221; Stephen asked, pityingly.
His heart went out to the stricken stranger. He wanted to ask another question,
too, but he hesitated. But finally he asked it. &#8220;Who are you, old
man?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment the fellow did not reply. The silence was oppressive. Stephen
regretted his question. Then suddenly the man answered him, weakly, bitterly, as
one utterly remorseful.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Jim,&#8221; he blurted out. &#8220;Horse-thief,
cattle-rustler.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stephen bit his lip. More than ever he regretted that he had asked. Well,
something had to be done, and done quickly. Could he but feel sure of his
direction, he might place this unfortunate upon Pat and walk with him to the
railroad town, where proper medical and surgical attendance could be obtained.
But this he was unable to do, since he fully realized he was astray.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; he suddenly explained, &#8220;I was headed, myself,
toward the railroad. A little before dark I lost my way. Do you happen to
know&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; interrupted the other, faintly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been&#8211;been lost&#8211;a week.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span>Stephen sat down
thoughtfully. All hope of serving the man for the present was gone. He must wait
till daybreak at least. Then somebody or something might appear to show him the
way out. He thought of the ranch wagon, and of Buddy&#8217;s offer, and it
occurred to him that unless he was too far off the regular course he might
attract Buddy. It was a chance, anyway.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been &#8217;most dead, too, for a week,&#8221; suddenly began the
other. &#8220;I &#8217;ain&#8217;t eat regularly, for one thing&#8211;&#8217;most a month of
that, I reckon. Been times, too, when I couldn&#8217;t&#8211;couldn&#8217;t find
water. I didn&#8217;t know the country over here. Had to change&#8211;change
horses a couple times, too. Because&#8211;&#8221; He checked himself. &#8220;I
made a mistake&#8211;the last horse. He give me all&#8211;all that was
comin&#8217;&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>A nicker from Pat interrupted him. Stephen felt him cringe. Directly he felt
something else. It was a cold hand groping to find his own. The whole thing was
queer, uncanny, and he was glad when the man went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did&#8211;did you hear that?&#8221; breathed the fellow, a note of
suppressed terror in his voice. &#8220;Did you hear it, friend? Tell me!&#8221;
His voice was shrill now.</p>

<p>Stephen reassured him, explaining that it was his horse. But a long time the
man held fast, fingers gripping his hand, as if he did not believe, and was
listening to make sure. At length he relaxed, and Stephen, still seated close
beside him, heard him sink back into the sand.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span>&#8220;I was
getting away from&#8211;from&#8211;Oh, well, it don&#8217;t&#8211;don&#8217;t
make any difference.&#8221; The fellow was silent. &#8220;I needed a&#8211;a
horse,&#8221; he continued, finally. &#8220;My own&#8211;the third
since&#8211;since&#8211;my own had played out. I was near a ranch, and&#8211;and
it was night, and I&#8211;I seen a corral with a horse standing in it&#8211;a
gray. It was moonlight. I&#8211;I got the gate open, and I&#8211;I roped him,
and&#8211;&#8221; He interrupted himself, was upon one elbow again. &#8220;It
was a stallion&#8211;a cross-bred, maybe&#8211;and&#8211;and say, friend, he
rode me to death! I got on him before I knowed what he was. Bareback. He shot
out of that corral like he was crazy. But I&#8211;I managed to hold&#8211;hold
to him and&#8211;if he&#8217;d only bucked me off! But he didn&#8217;t. He just
raced for it&#8211;tore across the country like a cyclone. He rode me to death,
a hundred miles, I bet, without a stop. And I held on&#8211;couldn&#8217;t let
go&#8211;was afraid to let go.&#8221; He was silent. &#8220;Are you&#8211;you
dead sure, friend, that was your horse?&#8221;</p>

<p>Stephen again reassured him, realizing the fear upon the man and now
understanding it. But he said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then somewhere off here he throwed me,&#8221; went on the man.
&#8220;But he&#8211;he was a raving maniac. He turned on me before I could get
up, and bit and kicked and trampled me till I didn&#8217;t know
nothing&#8211;was asleep, or something. When I came to&#8211;woke up&#8211;he
was still hanging around. He&#8217;s around here yet! I heard him all
day&#8211;yesterday! He&#8217;s off there to the east somewheres.
He&#8217;s&#8211;he&#8217;s looking for me. I kept still whenever I&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span> see him or hear
him, and then when he&#8217;d move off out of sight, or quit&#8211;quit his
nickering, I&#8217;d crawl along some more. I&#8217;m&#8211;I&#8217;m done,
stranger,&#8221; he concluded, weakly, dropping over upon his back.
&#8220;I&#8217;m done, and I know it. And it was that horse
that&#8211;that&#8211;&#8221; He was silent.</p>

<p>Stephen did not speak. He could not speak after this fearsome tale. Its
pictures haunted him. He could see this poor fellow racing across the desert,
clinging for life to that which meant death. His own condition had been brought
about through a horse, a horse and wild rides at a time when he should have
been, as this unfortunate undoubtedly should have been, in bed under medical
care. For a moment he thought he would tell him a tale of misery equal to his
own, in the hope that he might turn him from thoughts of his own misfortunes.
But before he could speak the other broke in upon his thoughts with a shrill
outcry. He had raised himself upon one elbow again, and now was pointing toward
the eastern sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Look off there!&#8221;</p>

<p>Stephen turned his eyes in the direction of the pointing finger. He saw a
faint light breaking through the black dome of the sky. As he watched it, it
trickled out steadily, like slow-spreading water, filtering slowly through dense
banks of clouds, folding them back like the shutter of a giant camera, until the
whole eastern sky was a field of gray clouds with frosty edges, between which,
coming majestically forward through the green-white billow, appeared finally a
moon, big <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span> and
round and brilliant, casting over the earth a flood of wonderland light,
streaming down upon the dunes and flats in mystic sheen, bringing out the desert
in soft outline. Near by, the light brought out the form of Pat, standing a
short distance off with drooping head, motionless in all the splendor of his
perfect outline. Stephen turned back to the man. He found him staring hard at
the horse. He did not understand this until the fellow burst out excitedly, his
eyes still fixed on Pat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whose horse is that?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;Tell me. Do you own
that black horse?&#8221;</p>

<p>Stephen slowly shook his head. He thought the question but another expression
of the stranger&#8217;s nervous apprehension due to his experience. Yet he
explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;He belongs back in New Mexico,&#8221; he said,
quietly&#8211;&#8220;the Rio Grande Valley. He was stolen last spring. Been
ridden pretty hard since, I guess. I happen to know where he belongs, though,
and I was taking him to a shipping-point when I lost my way. That&#8217;s the
horse you heard nicker a while ago,&#8221; he added, soothingly.</p>

<p>The man sank flat again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I stole him,&#8221; he blurted out. &#8220;I&#8211;I hope you&#8217;ll
get him back where he belongs. His&#8211;his name is Pat.
He&#8217;s&#8211;he&#8217;s the best horse I ever rode.&#8221; He relapsed, into
silence, motionless, as one dead.</p>

<p>Stephen himself remained motionless. He looked at the man curiously. He
believed that <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269'></a>269</span> he
ought to feel bitter toward him, since he saw in him the cause of all his own
misery. But somehow he found that he could feel nothing but pity. In this man
with eyes closed and gasping lips Stephen saw only a brother-mortal in distress,
as he himself was in distress, and he forgave him for anything he had done.</p>

<p>He looked at Pat, understanding the temptation, and then turned his eyes
pityingly toward the man&#8211;the stranger, dozing, murmuring strangely in his
sleep. Seeing him at rest, and realizing the long hours before daybreak, Stephen
finally dropped over upon one elbow, and prepared to pass the night as best he
could. He was suffering torture from his arm and shoulder, and burning with the
fever shown in his hot skin and parched lips.</p>

<p>The night passed restlessly. He saw the first rays of dawn break over the
range and creep farther and farther down the valley, throwing a pale pink over
the landscape and sending gaunt shadows slinking off into the light. A whinny
from Pat aroused him. He arose painfully, gazed at the man at his feet, and then
turned his eyes toward the distant horizon. A second whinny disturbed him and he
shifted his gaze. Far above two great buzzards, circling round and round, faded
into the morning haze. From a neighboring sand-dune a jack-rabbit appeared,
paused a quivering moment, then scurried from view. The morning light grew
brighter. A third whinny, and Pat now slowly started toward him. But <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270'></a>270</span> again he fastened his
eyes upon the distant horizon, hoping for a sight of the ranch wagon. But no
wagon appeared. At length he turned to the horse. Pat stood soberly regarding
the man, his ears forward, head drooping, tail motionless, as if recognizing in
this mute object an erstwhile master. And suddenly lifting his head, he sounded
a soft nicker, tremulously. Then again he fell to regarding the still form with
strange interest.</p>

<p>The form was still, still for all eternity. For the man was dead.</p>

<p>Stephen sat down. He was shaking with fever and weakness. He placed a
handkerchief over the face in repose, almost relieved that peace had come to
this troubled soul. Then he thought of possible action. He realized that he was
utterly lost. He had Pat, and for this he was thankful, since he knew that he
could at least mount the horse and leave him to find a way out. But the horse
alone must do it. He himself was bewildered, for the desert in broad day, as
much as in the long night, revealed nothing. On every hand it lay barren,
destitute of movement, wrapped in silence, seeming to mock his predicament. Yet
he could not bring himself to mount at once. He sat motionless, suffering
acutely, knowing that the least exertion would increase his pain&#8211;a machine
run down&#8211;not caring to move.</p>

<p>Suddenly, off to the east appeared a horse&#8211;a gray. It cantered
majestically to the top of a dune, and stood there&#8211;head erect, nostrils
quivering, ears alert, cresting the hillock like a statue. <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_271'></a>271</span> Stephen shivered. For instinctively he
knew this to be the gray stallion, the cross-bred, that had trampled the form
beside him. His first impulse was to mount Pat and spur him in a race for life;
his second impulse was to crouch in hiding in the hope of escaping the keen
scrutiny of that merciless demon. He chose the race. Springing to his feet, he
leaped for Pat, and he grasped the saddle-horn. In his haste he slipped, lost
his stirrup, and fell back headlong. The shock made him faint, and for a time he
was unconscious. Shrill neighing aroused him, and, hastily gaining his feet, he
saw Pat running lightly, well-contained, to meet the swiftly advancing gray
stallion. Then events moved with a terrible unreality.</p>

<p>The gray screamed defiantly and leaped toward Pat faster and faster. Pat
braced his legs to meet the assault. But no assault came. With rare craft the
gray suddenly checked himself, coming to a full stop two lengths away. Here,
with ears flat and lashing tail, he glared at Pat, who, equally tense, returned
defiance. Thus they stood in the desert, quiet, measuring each other, while
Stephen, crouched, watching them, remembering the lifeless form beside him,
prayed that Pat would prove equal to the mighty stallion. He had no gun. Pat
alone could save him. If Pat were conquered nothing remained but death for both.
For with Pat dead&#8211;and surely this masterful foe would stop at nothing
short of death&#8211;Stephen realized that he himself, in his present condition,
would never see civilization again. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_272'></a>272</span> He could not walk the distance even if he knew the
way, nor could he hope to mount the victorious stallion, should Pat be defeated,
because only one man had done that, and that man lay dead beside him. The
thought of being alone in the desert with the dead struck chill to his heart. He
recalled his first ride with Helen, and her tales of men and horses in the early
days, and what it meant to a man to have his horse stolen from him. It was all
clear to him now, and he clenched his sound hand till the nails cut the flesh.
Unless Pat fought a successful fight he was doomed to die of thirst, even if the
stallion did not attack him. As he looked at Pat, his only hope in this dread
situation, he prayed harder and more fervently than before that his champion
would win.</p>

<p>Pat thrilled with the sense of coming battle, but he did not fear this horse.
He remembered that once he had struck down a rival, and before that he had twice
given successful battle to men&#8211;to a finish with the Mexican hostler,
another time when he had brought his enemy to respect and consider him.
Therefore he had no reason to fear this horse, even though he saw in the
gray&#8217;s splendid figure an enemy to be carefully considered. But not for an
instant did Pat relax. For this was a crafty foe, as shown by his sudden halt,
which Pat knew was the prelude to a swift attack. So he watched with keen
alertness the flattened ears, the lashing tail&#8211;his own muscles held rigid,
waiting.</p>

<p>The gray began a cautious approach. He put <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_273'></a>273</span> forward his legs one after another slowly, the
while he held his eyes turned away, as if he were wholly absorbed in the
vastness of the desert reaches. This was but a mere feint, as Pat understood it,
and yet he waited, curious to know the outcome, still holding himself rigidly on
guard. Closer came the gray, closer still, until he was almost beside him. Pat
heard the whistle of his breath and saw the wild light in his eyes, and for an
instant feared him. Yet there was no attack. The gray calmly gained a point
immediately alongside and stopped, head to Pat&#8217;s rump, separated from him
by not more than half his length. Yet he did not attack; but Pat did not relax.
And again they stood, end to end now and side by side, until Pat, coming finally
to think, against his better judgment, that this was, after all, only a friendly
advance, became less watchful. Then the blow fell. With a shrill scream that
chilled Pat&#8217;s heart the gray leaped sideways with a peculiar broadside
lunge intended to hurl him off his feet. It was a form of attack new to Pat, and
therefore never known to his ancestors, and before he could brace himself to
meet it he found himself rolling over and over frantically in the sand.</p>

<p>He sprang up, screaming with rage, while the gray was trampling him with
fiendish hoofs. He steadied himself, resisted the onslaught, took the offensive
himself. He lunged with bared teeth, sank them into yielding flesh, and wheeled
away quickly. But not fast enough. The gray slashed his rump. He turned back,
tore the gray&#8217;s shoulder, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_274'></a>274</span> wheeled sharply, attacked with lightning heels, and
darted away again. But again the gray sprang upon him, ripped his rump a second
time, and sprang off like a fiend. Raging, vindictive, Pat hurtled after him,
and snapped again and again, drawing hot blood pungent of taste and smell, and
then he leaped aside. But not far enough. The gray dashed into him, enveloped
him in a whirlwind of clashing teeth and flashing heels, and wheeled away in a
wide circle, screaming to the heavens, leaving Pat, with a dozen stinging
wounds, dazed and exhausted.</p>

<p>But Pat was quick to recover himself. Also, he took council. Never had he
fought like this. His battle with the white horse had been brief&#8211;brief
because of sudden releasing of weeks of venom stored within him by the
white&#8217;s continuous nagging, brief because of the white&#8217;s inability
to spring from each attack in season to protect himself. But no such
sluggishness hampered this enemy, and he grimly realized that this was a
struggle to the death. But he felt no fear. He respected the other&#8217;s craft
and wit and strength. Yet he knew that he himself had strength, while he
realized that strength alone would not conquer. Craft and wit must serve with
strength. Having strength, he himself must adopt the other qualities, must adapt
himself to the occasion, exercise wit and craft, wait for openings, feint and
withdraw, feint and attack, until, wearying this enemy, and puzzling him, there
would come the chance to strike a death-blow. He knew what <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_275'></a>275</span> the death-blow was&#8211;knew it from
his encounter with the white. He must inflict it first, lest the gray anticipate
him, for the gray undoubtedly knew, also, from his experience and from his
ancestors, what the death-blow was.</p>

<p>After a moment of gasping breath and gradually clearing eyes he felt
self-control and assurance return. Since his enemy appeared to be waiting, he
himself continued to wait. He waited three minutes, five minutes, ten, until the
nervous tension would permit him to wait no longer. Remembering his plans, and
emulating the first approach of the gray, he started slowly toward him, putting
forward one foot after another quietly, his eyes upon the distant horizon. He
even outdid the gray in his craft. As he drew near, he suddenly took on the
manner of one seeking friendliness, nickering once softly, as if he had had
enough of this and would ask reconciliation. But his ruse failed. The gray was
wise with the wisdom of the world-free. Plunging suddenly upon him, he snapped
for his ears, but missed. His teeth flashed at Pat&#8217;s neck, lodged, and
ripped the flesh. He whirled, lashed out with his heels, missed, and sped away.
Pat wheeled again and again, almost overthrown, and staggered away.</p>

<p>Again he took council with himself. He was not beaten, he knew that. But
neither was the enemy beaten. He knew that also. And he knew he must bide his
time. Twice he had closed with the enemy, and twice he had come away the worse.
Nothing was to be gained by this method. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_276'></a>276</span> He must bide his time, wait for an encounter, dodge
it if the moment proved unpropitious, but refrain from close attack. He must
wait for his chance.</p>

<p>As he stood there, alert to every least thing, he suddenly awoke to tease
breathing close behind him. For one flaming moment he was puzzled. Then he
remembered that he had been watching the gray out of the corner of his eye. He
had seemed to be off guard, and the other had stolen cautiously around behind
him, evidently to take advantage of this chance. He swallowed hard. The enemy
was stealing upon him. He wanted to wheel, believed he ought to wheel if he
would save himself, but he did not. Instead, he brought craft into play. He
listened patiently, intensely alert, and bided his time. The breathing came
closer, closer still, and stopped. He heard the enemy swallow. He conquered his
longing to turn, and remained still as death. The gray drew no closer. He seemed
to be waiting, also biding his time. And now it became a test, a matter of
nervous endurance, each waiting for the other. Around them pressed the desert
solitude. There was no sound anywhere. The sun beat down upon the earth
remorselessly. And still Pat waited, but not for long. There was a soft tread
behind him, and he knew that he had won in the contest of endurance. With the
footfalls he heard spasmodic breathing. And yet he waited. But he was ready to
strike&#8211;to deal the death-blow. Closer came the restrained breathing, was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277'></a>277</span> close behind him.
Then he struck with all his strength.</p>

<p>And his lightning heels found their mark. He heard the crack of bone and a
long, terrible scream. He wheeled and saw the gray limping away. Gripped in
sudden overwhelming fury, sounding a cry no less shrill than that of the gray,
he leaped upon the enemy, bore him to earth, and, knowing no mercy, he trampled
and slashed the furiously resisting foe into a bleeding mass. Then he dashed
off, believing that it was all over. He turned toward Stephen and flung up his
head to sound a cry of joy. But he did not sound it, for, taken off his guard,
he suddenly found himself bowled over by the frenzied impact of the gray.</p>

<p>And Stephen, tense with suspense, felt hope sink within him. For the gray
stallion, even with fore leg broken, was smothering the prostrate Pat in a
raging attack. He saw Pat struggle time and again to gain his feet. At last,
only after desperate effort, he saw him rise. He saw him spring upon the
crippled gray and tear his back and neck and withers until his face and chest
were covered with blood. And then&#8211;and at sight of this he went limp in joy
and relief&#8211;he saw Pat wheel against the gray and lash out mightily, and he
saw the gray drop upon breast and upper fore legs&#8211;hopelessly out of the
struggle. For Pat had broken the second fore leg, and this fiend of the desert
was down for all time.</p>

<p>And now Pat did a strange thing. As if it suddenly came to him that he had
done a forbidden <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278'></a>278</span>
thing&#8211;for, after all, he was a product of advanced civilization&#8211;he
flung up his head a second time and sounded a babyish whimper. Then he trotted
straight to Stephen, there to nestle, as one seeking sympathy, under his
master&#8217;s enfolding arms. And Stephen, understanding, caressed and hugged
and talked to him in a fervor of gratitude, until, awaking to the distress of
the stallion, he staggered to his feet, intent upon a search for a revolver in
the clothing of the still form. He found one, unexpectedly, in concealing folds,
and with it shot the gray. Then he dragged himself to Pat, clambered dizzily
into the saddle, gave the horse loose rein.</p>

<p>Pat set out at a walk. He was bleeding in many places, and he was sore and
burning in many others. But he did not permit these things to divert him from
his task. He went on steadily, going he knew not whither, until he felt his
master become inert in the saddle. This troubled him, and, without knowing
precisely why he did it, he freshened his gait and continued at a fox-trot well
into the morning, until his alert eyes suddenly caught sight of a thin column of
dust flung up by galloping horses and swiftly revolving wheels. Then he came to
a halt, and, still not understanding his motives, he pointed his head toward the
distant vehicle and sounded a shrill nicker.</p>

<p>The effort brought disaster. He felt his young master slip out of the saddle,
saw him totter and sink in a heap on the sand. And now he understood fully.
Throwing up his head again, he <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_279'></a>279</span> awoke the desert with an outcry that racked his
whole body. But he did not stop. Again and again he flung his call across the
silence, hurling it in mighty staccato in the direction of the ranch wagon until
he saw the man suddenly draw rein, remain still for a time, then start up the
horses again, this time in his direction. And now, and not till now, he ceased
his nickering, and, in the great weariness and fatigue upon him, let his head
droop, with eyes closed, until his nose almost touched the ground.</p>

<p>And although he did not know it, in the past four hours this dumb animal had
in every way lived up to the faith and trust reposed in him by the little woman
in the distant valley.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280'></a>280</span><a id='link_22'></a>CHAPTER XXII<br /><span class='h2fs'>QUIESCENCE</span></h2>

<p>After long jogging behind the ranch wagon Pat found himself back in a stable.
He found himself attended once more by the round-faced and smiling young man who
had looked after him before. This friend put salve upon his wounds, and after
that, for days and days, provided him with food and water, sometimes talking to
him hopefully, sometimes talking with quiet distress in his voice, sometimes
attending to his wants without talking at all. It was all a dread monotony. The
days became shorter; the nights became longer; a chill crept into the stable.
All day long he stamped away the hours in restless discontent, longing for a
change of some sort, longing for a sight of his young master, wanting to get out
into the open, there to race his legs off in thrilling action.</p>

<p>Once this wish was granted. The weather was quite cold, and his round-faced
friend came to him that morning showing every sign of haste. Hurriedly he
bridled and saddled Pat, rushed him out of the stable, flung up across his back,
and put spur to him with such vigor that he was forced <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_281'></a>281</span> into a gait the like of which he had
not taken since his breathless speeding to the accompaniment of shots. Out
across the desert he raced, breasting a cold wind, on and on till he found
himself in a small railroad town. Here he was pulled up before a little cottage,
and saw his friend mount the front steps and pull a tiny knob in the frame of
the door. A moment of waiting and he saw a portly man appear, heard sharp
conversation, saw his friend run down the steps. Then again he felt the prick of
spurs, and found himself once more cantering across the desert. But not toward
home. Late in the afternoon, wearied and suffering hunger pangs, he found
himself in another small town and before another tiny cottage, with his friend
pulling at a knob as before, and entering into crisp conversation with the
person who answered, a lean man this time, who nodded his head and withdrew.
After this he once more breasted the cold winds, worse now because of the night,
and continued to breast them until he found himself back in the stable.</p>

<p>Thus he had his wish. But it was really more than he had wanted, and
thereafter he was content to remain in peace and rest in the stable. But he was
not always confined to the stable now. His friend began to permit him
privileges, and one of these was the spending of long hours outdoors in a
private corral. Here, basking in the sunlight, which was not free from winter
chill, he would spend whole days dreaming and wondering&#8211;wondering for the
most part about his master, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_282'></a>282</span> the master he liked, and finding himself ever more
distressed because of his continued absence. Sometimes, in the corral, he would
see men walk slowly in and out of the ranch-house, or come to a halt outside his
fence and stand for long minutes gazing at him, a look in their eyes, he
thought, though he was not quite sure, of pity mingled with sorrow. But though
these men came to him frequently, yet they rarely ever spoke to him; even as his
round-faced friend, though still regularly attentive, rarely ever spoke to him
now. It was all mysterious. He knew that something of a very grave nature was in
the air, but what it was and why his real master never came to him as did the
other men, he did not know, though sometimes he would be obsessed with troubled
thoughts that all was not well with the young man.</p>

<p>Then one day, with spring descending upon the desert, he saw something that
quickened his interest in life. He saw a door open in the house, saw a very thin
young man appear on the threshold, saw him slowly descend the steps and walk
toward him. It was his master. Yet was it? He pressed close to the fence, gazed
at the man long and earnestly. Then he knew. It was indeed the same young man.
He was much thinner now than when last he had come to him, and he seemed to lack
his old-time energy, but nevertheless it was he. In a moment he knew it for
certain, for the man held out a long, thin, white hand and called his name.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283'></a>283</span>This was the
beginning of the end. Thereafter two and three times a day the young man came to
him, sometimes in the corral, sometimes in the stable, but always with each
successive visit, it seemed to Pat, revealing increasing buoyancy and strength.
And finally there came a day, bright and warm, when his master came to him, as
it proved, to remain with him. The young man was dressed for riding, and he was
surrounded by all the men Pat had ever seen about the place, and not a few whose
faces were new to him. They led him out of the stable into the open, a dozen
hands bridled and saddled him, then all crowded close in joyful
conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir,&#8221; began the round-faced young man, slapping Pat
resoundingly upon the rump, &#8220;you&#8217;re off again! And believe me
I&#8217;m one that&#8217;s right sorry to see you go. I don&#8217;t care
nothin&#8217; about this pardner o&#8217; yours&#8211;he don&#8217;t count
nohow, anyway. He&#8217;s been sick &#8217;most to death, shore, but he&#8217;s all
right now as far as <i>that</i> goes. His arm is all healed up, and he&#8217;s
fit in every other way&#8211;<i>some</i> ways&#8211;yet he&#8217;s takin&#8217;
himself off from as nice people as ever dragged saddles through a bunk-house at
midnight. But that ain&#8217;t it. He&#8217;s takin&#8217; old black hoss away
with him, and it don&#8217;t jest set. I shore do hate to see you go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Which seemed to express the opinions of the others. And somehow, even when
his master was in the saddle and everything pointing to a final departure, Pat
found himself hating to go. But duty was duty, and after his master had gathered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284'></a>284</span> up the reins and
all had cordially shaken hands he broke into a canter, and, followed by a chorus
of mighty yells, headed into the interminable desert, within him the feeling of
one upon the threshold of new life, or of old and delightful life returned.
Before he realized either the lapse of time or the distance traveled, he found
himself cantering into the little railroad town he had visited so hurriedly in
the winter. And there followed another experience new to Pat&#8211;a journey by
train back to his home.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285'></a>285</span><a id='link_23'></a>CHAPTER XXIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE REUNION</span></h2>

<p>Stephen awoke quite late in the morning after his arrival in Pat&#8217;s home
town. Standing before a window in his room at the hotel, he saw a young woman
cantering across the railroad tracks in the direction of the mesa. It was Helen,
and, at sight of her, for a brief and awful moment he wavered in his decision.
Then he remembered his suffering, and the determination made while convalescing,
and, hastening his toilet, he hurried through breakfast and made his way to the
livery-stable where Pat had spent the night. Pat nickered joyful greeting, as if
understanding what was to come. Bridling and saddling him, Stephen mounted and
rode into the street at a canter. He turned into the avenue, crossed the
railroad tracks, and mounted the long, slow rise to the mesa at a walk. He moved
slowly because he wanted time to think, to pull himself together, to the end
that he might hold himself firmly to his decision in this last talk. And
yet&#8211;and this was the conflict he suffered&#8211;he could hardly restrain
himself, hold himself back, from urging Pat to his utmost.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286'></a>286</span>He reached the
first flat in the long rise. Absorbed in troubled reflections, he was barely
conscious of the nods from two men he passed whom he knew&#8211;Hodgins, kindly
old soul, book in hand; Maguire, truest of Celts, a twenty-inch slide-rule under
his arm. Nodding in friendly recognition, both men gazed at the horse, seeming
to understand, and glad to know that he was back. Mounting the second rise, he
saw another whom he knew. A quarter of a mile to his left, on the tiny porch of
a lone adobe, sat Skeet under a hat, feet elevated to the porch railing, head
turned in a listening attitude, as though heeding a call, or many calls, from
the direction of a brick-and-stone structure to the southwest. Everywhere
familiar objects, scenes, stray people, caught his eye as he rode slowly out
upon the mesa, trying to get his thoughts away from the immediate future, from
Helen, his successful return of the horse, and that other thing, his
determination to leave this spacious land for ever.</p>

<p>Suddenly he saw her. She was standing beside her brown saddler, her hand upon
the bridle, gazing thoughtfully toward the mountains, now in their morning
splendor. He rode Pat to a point perhaps twenty feet behind her, and then
quietly let go of the reins and dropped to earth. For a moment he stood, his
heart a well of bitterness; then, taking Pat&#8217;s rein, he stepped toward
her, quietly and slowly, intent upon making her surprise complete, because of
her great love for the horse. She continued motionless, her hand upon <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287'></a>287</span> the bridle, facing the
mountains, and he came close before she turned.</p>

<p>He stopped. She stood perfectly still, eyes upon him, upon the horse, a slow
pallor creeping into her face. Presently, as one in a spell, she let fall the
reins, slowly, mechanically, and stepped toward him, a step ever quickening, her
face drawn, in her eyes a strange, unchanging glow, until, when almost upon him,
she held out both arms in trembling welcome and uttered a pitiful outcry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stephen! Pat!&#8221; she sobbed. &#8220;Why&#8211;why didn&#8217;t
you&#8211;&#8221; She checked herself, came close, reached one arm around Pat,
the other around Stephen, and went on. &#8220;I am&#8211;am glad you&#8211;you
have come back&#8211;back to me.&#8221; Her white face quivered. &#8220;Both of
you. I&#8211;I have suffered.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Stephen, swept away by the tide of his great love, and forgetting his
determination, forgetting everything, bent his head and kissed her. She did not
shrink, and he kissed her again. Then he began to talk, to tell her of her
wonderful horse. Slowly at first, hesitating, then, as the spirit of the drama
gripped him, rapidly, sometimes incoherently, he told of his adventures with the
horse, and of Pat&#8217;s unwavering loyalty throughout, and of that last dread
situation when both their lives depended upon Pat&#8217;s winning in a
death-grapple with a wild horse. And then, as the gates of speech were opened,
he showed her his own part, telling her that as Pat had been <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288'></a>288</span> true to her trust, so he
himself had tried to be true to her faith and trust, and was still trying and
hoping, against his convictions, that she understood, that she would consider
his love for her and would take him, because he loved her wholly and he needed
her love to live. His tense words broke at last, and then he saw her looking up
at him through tear-dimmed eyes and smiling, and in the smile he saw the opening
of a life new and wonderful.</p>

<p>After a little she turned to Pat. She fell to stroking him in thoughtful
silence. Then she turned back.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had heard much of what you have been through,&#8221; she began,
slowly, her voice soft and vibrant with deep sympathy, in her eyes that same
steady glow. &#8220;The rangers reported to headquarters, and headquarters
reported to Daddy. They told of the running fight, Stephen, and how&#8211;how
you were hurt. And they told of the renegades, and their descent upon your camp,
and of Pat&#8217;s disappearance. And they told of the way you mounted another
horse, hurt and sick though you were, and rode off in pursuit. But from there
they knew nothing more. But they had spoken of the cavalry, and I wrote to Fort
Wingate, inquiring, and they told me what they knew&#8211;that you had joined
them and ridden with them through that dreadful fight, though they had tried to
keep you out of it on account of your condition, and that afterward you had gone
off with some cowboys&#8211;they didn&#8217;t know to what ranch. So I looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289'></a>289</span> up every brand in
that section, Stephen,&#8221; she went on, her voice beginning to break.
&#8220;And I wrote to every place that might by any possible chance know
something. But nobody knew. And&#8211;and&#8211;there I&#8211;I was stopped. You
had been swallowed up in that desert, and I&#8211;I knew you must be
ill&#8211;and I realized that I&#8211;I had sent you into it all.&#8221; She
sobbed and leaned her head against him. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t do anything,
Stephen. I was helpless. All I have been able to do at any time, Stephen, was
to&#8211;to sit at a window and wait&#8211;wait to hear from you&#8211;wait for
your return&#8211;and hope, hope day in and day out that&#8211;that you were
safe. I&#8211;I have&#8211;have suffered, Stephen,&#8221; she concluded, sobbing
wretchedly now. &#8220;I have suffered&#8211;suffered so much!&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew her close in his arms, united at last in complete understanding. The
brown saddler, left free, wandered away indifferently; but Pat remained beside
them, and presently they felt the tender touch of his beautiful head, as if in
comprehension and blessing. Their hands went out to him, and Pat nickered softly
at the love in their caress. Then Stephen gently raised Helen&#8217;s sweet,
tear-stained face to his, and in her eyes he read the certainty of the great
happiness of years to come, while Pat, raising his head proudly to the desert,
stood above them as if in solemn protection.</p>
